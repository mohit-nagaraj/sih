(File)Guwahati:Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that there might have been a \"mistake\" in the identification of the body of a \"dacoit\", killed in a police encounter in Udalguri district last week, as the family of his alleged associate claimed it was of their relative. Mr Sarma, on Tuesday, however, stood firm by the police action in the incident, claiming that it was the suspected dacoits who had first shot at the cops.The body has been exhumed and process for due identification initiated, a top police officer said.The Congress sought the intervention of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), saying it is a serious matter if someone is shot dead by the police on mistaken identity.\"We have given the case to CID to probe the mistaken identity angle. Usually, the deputy commissioner's office does the inquest of a dead. They might have done the probe hurriedly and made a mistake,\" Mr Sarma told reporters in Guwahati.One person was killed in a shootout on February 24 while two policemen suffered bullet injuries. It took place after the police, following a tip-off about an impending robbery, went to a place where a most-wanted dacoit Kenaram Basumatary and his aide were purportedly present. The other man managed to escape.Police later claimed that the dead was Basumatary and the body was handed over to his family after identification by the mother, following which the family members buried it as per rituals on Friday.The confusion arose when the family of one Dimbeshwar Muchahary from the neighbouring Baksa district came to the office of the Udalguri superintendent of police on Saturday evening and claimed that the buried body was his.The family asserted that Basumatary had asked Muchahary to accompany him to some place and they left together a few days ago. The identity and whereabouts of the second person involved in the encounter are not yet known.The Chief Minister pointed out that Basumatary's mother and brother had identified the body, which led the police to hand it to them.Asked if the police firing was done without ascertaining the identity of the suspects, Mr Sarma, who also holds the Home portfolio, said it was a retaliatory action.\"Whatever be the case, the police were not wrong in firing. There was a firing from a vehicle at the police party. One sub-inspector and a constable were injured. When police fired (in retaliation), they did not even know if it was Kenaram or Dimbeshwar in the vehicle,\" he said.Meanwhile, senior Congress leaders Debabrata Saikia and Rakibul Hussain, who visited Udalguri on Tuesday, sought the NHRC's intervention in the matter.In a letter to the NHRC chairman, they said the shootout has 'raised the question of violation of human rights as well as abuse of police law in action'.\"A suspect shot and killed by police on mistaken identity is a serious matter,\" Mr Saikia, who is the leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, and his deputy Mr Hussain said.They demanded a proper enquiry to verify the identity of the dead, compensation to the victim's family and adherence by law-enforcing agencies to procedure for arrest and punishment \"rather than resorting to extreme means like encounter\".Police have maintained that Basumatary was wanted in several cases of armed robberies in Assam as well as neighbouring Meghalaya.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMuchahary alias Gobla is also a criminal who had been arrested with arms earlier, and he and Basumtary are also shown as absconders in one case.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The two men have spoken by phone since but about other issues and not the war.Lavrov arrived late Tuesday in India -- which has not condemned the war -- and will use his G20 attendance to lay into the West, according to the Russian foreign ministry.Western countries want to \"take revenge for the inevitable disappearance of the levers of dominance from its hands,\" the ministry's English-language statement said.\"The destructive policy of the US and its allies has already put the world on the brink of a disaster, provoked a rollback in socio-economic development and seriously aggravated the situation of the poorest countries,\" it added.'Spy balloon'Similarly in doubt on the sidelines of the two-day G20 gathering in New Delhi was a meeting between Blinken and his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang.Blinken had a fiery encounter with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi last month in Germany after the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon over its east coast on February 4.The incident led Blinken to nix a rare trip to China, slamming the \"unacceptable violation of US sovereignty and international law\" which \"must never again occur,\" the State Department said.Beijing, which has also been angered by Washington's stance on Taiwan, denies it uses spy balloons and says the craft was for weather research.Wang \"urged the US side to change course, acknowledge and repair the damage that its excessive use of force caused to China-US relations,\" state news agency Xinhua reported.'Material support'Blinken also warned Wang against providing \"material support\" to Russia's faltering war effort, as is speculated in Washington. Beijing denies any such intention.State news agency Xinhua quoted Wang last week as saying China was willing to \"strengthen strategic coordination\" with Russia after meeting Lavrov and President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Blinken was also expected to meet on Friday his counterparts from the Quad group -- Japan, Australia and India -- that is seen as a bulwark against China in the Asia-Pacific region.Awkward hostsThe Group of Twenty comprises 19 countries and the European Union, representing around 85 percent of the world's economy and two-thirds of its population.India wants its G20 presidency this year to focus on issues like alleviating poverty and climate finance, but the Ukraine war and its effects are set to dominate the agenda.Last week a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Bengaluru failed to agree on a common statement after Russia and China sought to water down language on the Ukraine war.Hosting the G20 puts India in a tricky position, because while it shares Western concerns about China it is also a major buyer of Russian arms and has ramped up oil imports.India has not condemned the invasion, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Putin last year that this was \"not a time for war\" in comments seen as a rebuke to Moscow.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Saturday on a visit to India that he did not believe that Modi's government \"is under any illusions that this is an offensive war started by Russia in order to acquire a part of its neighbour's territory.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "New Delhi:In a major setback to real estate companies in Noida and Greater Noida areas, the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to rescind its November 7 order refusing to recall an earlier decision that had capped the rate of interest at eight per cent on dues for land given on lease to different builders.\"We have examined the interim applications which have now been filed by various group of companies for recalling of the order dated November 7, 2022, pursuant to which we consciously recalled our orders dated June 10, 2020, August 19, 2020 and August 25, 2020 and in the present facts and circumstances, we find no reason/justification to recall our order dated 7th November 7, 2022. Consequently, the interim applications are without substance and deserve to be dismissed,\" said a bench of justices Ajay Rastogi and Bela M Trivedi.The top court had passed various orders including the one issued on June 10, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic period, by which it had capped the rate of interest at eight per cent on the dues for land given on lease to several builders in order to provide them the succour.The bench noted that the undisputed facts which have come on record are that the initiation of proceedings in the first instance in Amrapali case was only confined to consider how to secure the interests of homebuyers of Amrapali Group of companies and at a later stage, interim application was filed by the Ace Group of companies and later few other group of companies also intervened in the proceedings.It said that admittedly either of the builders who have moved the top court for recall of the November 7, last year order are in no manner were related to the functioning of the Amrapali Group of companies.On November 7 last year, the top court had recalled its order of June 10, 2020 which had capped the rate of interest at eight per cent on the dues for land given on lease to different builders, according to a lawyer. It had allowed the application of Noida and Greater Noida seeking recall of the 2020 order on the ground that both the authorities have been suffering huge losses and their functioning have virtually come to a standstill.The Noida and Greater Noida authorities had submitted that both the authorities were to incur losses of more than Rs 7,500 crore, if the June, 2020, order was not recalled. Both the authorities had alleged that different builders have suppressed the facts from the court leading to the passing of June 10, 2020 order favouring the real estate companies in Noida and Greater Noida areas.Advocates ML Lahoty and Anchit Sripat had espoused the cause of home buyers in the Amrapali case. Senior advocate Ravindra Kumar, appearing for both the Noida and Greater Noida authorities, had told the court that the top court by its order dated June 10, 2020 has curtailed the interest charged by the authority from the year 2010 onwards, under contracts entered into by it with builders and under which large tracts of lands belonging to the state have been made available for private exploitation by builders.He had submitted that though the Noida authority had argued the matter before passing of the 2020 order but the fact of the matter is that a builder (Ace Group) on whose plea the order was passed had colluded with lower rank officials and no notice was served upon the authority as a result no proper response was filed to the petition.He had also pointed out that it was not a case that many builders were involved in the matter as at the time of order only Ace Group was before the court and Panchsheel builders and Supertech Group came before the court at a later stage.The Noida authority had further submitted that the Ace Group suppressed the facts on land interest rates, default in paying lease premiums while the company itself charged 18 per cent compound interest from buyers and the fact that they had already delivered a couple of projects even before the Amrapali case was filed in 2017.Mr Kumar had said that the builders charge 18 percent interest while authority used to charge 11 per cent compounded annually payable in easy instalments but they were penalised because of the order. He had said that the authority's working is at standstill and bearing huge losses in view of the order as now several commercial, individual, institutions are approaching the authority seeking re-settlement of dues in view of the eight per cent cap imposed by the top court in its June 2020 order.Mr Kumar had said that on June 9, 2020, considering the problems in cash flow created by the Covid pandemic and its aftermath, the state government had directed a reduction of the interest being charged by the authority but this reduction in interest rates was only to apply prospectively and there was no question of refunding any interest already recovered, or reducing past demands of interest.However, builders have opposed the application of the authorities.On June 10, 2020, the real estate companies in Noida and Greater Noida areas which were reeling under slowdown and impact of Covid-19 induced lockdown had got the much needed relief when the Supreme Court had capped the rate of interest at eight per cent to be charged by authorities on the outstanding dues of land against the exorbitant 15 to 23 per cent.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe top court had said considering the current state of real estate sector, the projects have come to a standstill and the sector needs to be given impetus mainly considering plight of home buyers.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The police allege Atiq Ahmed, who is in a jail in Ahmedabad, sent five or six of his closest associates to kill the witness before he could record his statement before the police.Atiq Ahmed, along with his son Asad Ahmed and wife and BSP leader Shaista Parveen, were named in the FIR on the killing.One of the accused was killed in an alleged encounter with the police on Monday.This morning, bulldozers arrived to demolish the home in Prayagraj of Zafar Ahmed, another close aide of Atiq Ahmed, who is also missing since the shootout. Reports suggest Atiq Ahmed's wife and son were also in the bungalow. Sources say during a search of the bungalow, the police found arms and ammunition.Reports said earlier today, the police raided Atiq Ahmed's home in Lucknow and seized two luxury cars.Recently, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had lashed out at the Samajwadi Party in the assembly, stating that his government would \"run the mafia into the ground\".PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Is it not true that the accused against whom the FIR has been lodged, was made an MP by Samajwadi Party?

The dog ripped a part of her right arm while she was walking with her colleagues on Tolstoy Marg in Central Delhi. The attack caused her to undergo surgeries at a private hospital.Ms Mudaliar, who is going through physical and mental trauma, shares how the owners were so callous and were not cognizant of the fact that their carelessness has caused severe damage. \"They did not offer anything more than a verbal apology. As of today, I have not received any communication from their side,\" said the journalist.A case under the Indian Penal Code's sections 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) were registered at the Barakhamba Road police station on her complaint. The owner of the dog Shripriya Agarwal and the caretaker, Rampal, was arrested on February 3 but were released on bail the same day.Considering the large size of the wound (10 cm x 7 cm) - a chunk of flesh had come from Ms Mudaliar's right arm just above the elbow - it will take multiple surgeries over the next few months and possibly years for a full recovery.Ms Mudaliar's treatment will be in multiple stages. The focus of the current treatment is to restore tissue loss using skin grafting and other advanced surgeries. The situation is complicated due to the location of the injury.Talking about the surgeries, she told NDTV, \"In the first stage, I had two surgeries. The first surgery happened on February 1 under emergency conditions, and the second surgery will take place on March 1. The next stage of the treatment will depend on how the wound heals.\"\"The flesh ripped apart by the pit bull will never grow back naturally, and it can only be covered up artificially to some extent,\" said she added.The injury has already started interfering with Ms Mudaliar's day-to-day life. \"I am not able to do the routine of my normal work, including domestic and official duties. Now the spirit, enthusiasm, and alacrity have all been shattered, and I don't know what my future holds.\"Apart from the physical and mental trauma, the woman added, \"This has been an additional, unexpectedly large expense. I am worried about how much this will cost for future treatments.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMs Mudaliar recalled a conversation with the pet owner who said she has never walked her dog and always used a dog walker. \"This statement nullifies the meaning of having a pet, which is also like your family/child in many ways. Her statement just showed her callous attitude towards her own pet and a lack of responsibility as a pet owner/parent.\"She said that owning any animal is not a hobby, it is a lifelong responsibility. \"Well-known aggressive and powerful breeds with strong jaws, such as pit bulls, necessitate special handling (short and strong leashes, proper muzzles, etc.) that must be implemented before the pet can be owned. There are rules regarding this particular breed in Delhi NCR, Noida, Ghaziabad, and Gurugram that must be properly adhered to,\" she concluded.",

(Representational)Mumbai:A new born would mean both a full-term baby and a pre-term baby, the Bombay High Court on Wednesday said while directing an insurance company to pay Rs 11 lakh medical expenses incurred by a woman from Mumbai for the treatment of her twin babies born premature.A division bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Neela Gokhale also directed the New India Assurance company to pay an additional sum of Rs five lakh to the woman for attempting to interpret clauses in its insurance policies, contrary to their true spirit, only with a view to avoid honouring claims.The court noted the approach of the insurance company was \"unreasonable, unjust and contrary to the fundamental utmost good faith ethic of an insurance policy\".\"These submissions are the sheerest casuistry. They cannot be allowed to succeed,\" the HC said.The woman, a legal practitioner, moved the HC in 2021 after the insurance company refused her claims on the ground that the policy only covers new born babies who are born full-term and not babies born pre-term.The woman in her plea said the insurance company's refusal to accept her claims was arbitrary and contrary to the Insurance Regulatory And Development Authority of India (IRDAI) guidelines.The petition said there was no rational classification, nor intelligible differentia between new-born and premature babies.The insurance company opposed the petition and said the petitioner's twins developed complications due to their premature birth and would not have occurred in a baby born full-term.The bench, however, refused to accept this argument and said the insurance company's rejection of the petitioner's claim was \"contrary to law, unreasonable and arbitrary, and liable to be set aside\".\"The distinction between a 'new-born' and a 'premature baby' or a baby born 'pre-term' is baseless as a new-born baby can be one that is born 'full term' or 'pre-term'. A full term baby does not become more 'newer' any more than a 'pre-term' baby becomes an 'earlier born' or, to make it even more pointed, 'old born',\" the court said.The bench noted that it has taken the petitioner, a young mother and professional, considerable trials and tribulations and the roller coaster litigation process to bring the matter to its logical conclusion.\"The aim of reposing faith in the insurance company is pre-eminently to guard/provide against dangers which beset human life and dealings, by agreeing to pay the consideration in the form of premiums, as per the terms of the policy,\" it said.The court said the petitioner did not even have the time to revel in the birth of her twin babies and nurse them to health when she faced the \"rude shock\" of rejection of her legitimate claim by the insurance company.\"The insurance company cannot be permitted to play fast and loose with the faith reposed by the insured, and that too, supported by regular renewals and payments of premium, by attempting to interpret clauses in its policies, contrary to their true spirit and only with a view to avoid honouring claims,\" it said.The bench said it deemed it \"fit and proper, in the interests of justice\" and directed the insurance company to pay the woman an additional Rs five lakh as the cost of litigation.All the amount would have to be paid within a period of four weeks, the court said.As per the plea, the woman had in 2007 taken two mediclaim policies for Rs 20 lakhs from the New India Assurance Company which were renewed periodically.In September 2018, the woman delivered twin baby boys at 30 weeks' gestation in an emergency Caesarean surgery. The babies were premature and had to be admitted to the NeoNatal Intensive Care Unit for life-saving treatment.After their discharge, the petitioner submitted a claim to the insurance company and claimed Rs 11 lakh for the expenses incurred by her.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comHowever, the company repudiated her claims.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The video uploaded last year, they said, shows Elvish in the car at a rally in Rajasthan. Sharing screenshots from both videos, they said the car in the flower pots' theft clip and the one in the Rajasthan rally have the same registration number.Soon after, Elvish was accused of stealing flower pots and memers had a field day, with many taking a dig at the influencer.In a tweet late last night, Elvish Yadav said the vehicle in the flower pots' video does not belong to him. \"This is not my vehicle. I kindly ask everyone not to spread any untrue information about me. I am suing the people who are spreading false information about me.\"This is not my vehicle.

When Elvish replied, \"You don't even have a home\", Utkarsh Singh had another counter, \"I have asked the landlord to keep the flower pots inside.\"The influencer got into another argument with parody handle \"Dr Nimo Yadav\".

However, he was eventually caught after officials found that his name was not there in the list of selected candidates when salary bills for 582 trainees were being prepared.Though the Congress had submitted a notice for discussion in the House on Tuesday under rule 116 of the Assembly, which deals with matter of \"urgent public importance\", senior party MLA Amit Chavda sought a discussion on Wednesday itself, calling the incident \"serious\" and saying that there may be many others who have gained entry into the academy through such illegal means.Congress MLA Shailesh Parmar said though the party has given a notice for discussion under rule 116 and it may come up for discussion after some days, the state government can at least give an assurance to the House because the issue affects all the youths of Gujarat.When Mr Chaudhary rejected their demand saying he cannot bypass the rules and he has to give at least two days to the concerned minister to come with his reply under rule 116, Congress MLAs started shouting slogans and waving placards demanding a discussion today itself alleging that the government is promoting corrupt practices.They also sought resignation of Minister of State for Home, Harsh Sanghavi, and also sought an explanation from Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel.In his response, Chief Minister Patel condemned Congress's demand and said his government is capable of curbing all kinds of illegal activities.\"The House is not meant for satisfying the wishes of a person or a party. Recently, as you have seen, we brought a law to curb paper leaks and also took part in the discussion. My government is capable of stopping all kinds of illegal activities.

        "text": "New Delhi:The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked authorities to complete the process of installation of CCTVs in police stations to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court's order.The court's direction came on a petition for installation of functional CCTV cameras in all the police stations in the city.The Delhi Police, in a status report, submitted that fresh bids for equipment were invited through the GeM portal last year and at present, the tender is at the stage of evaluation and \"it is working on commencing the tender process expeditiously\".In January, the police had told the court that 1,941 CCTV cameras have been installed and are operational in 197 police stations here and a fresh e-bid had been invited for installing 2,175 additional cameras having audio-video recording facility.\"In view of the above status report, let bids be evaluated and order be placed on the successful bidder to ensure compliance of the Supreme Court order,\" said Justice Prathiba M Singh.In view of the pendency of the issue before the top court, the court closed the proceedings in the present matter, saying no further orders were required in this petition and the petitioner will be at liberty to avail the remedies available to him in law.In an earlier status report, the police had said that after the top court's December 2020 judgment directing installation of CCTV cameras with storage period of 18 months, the Commissioner of Police has constituted a committee of senior police officers to examine the matter as expeditiously as possible.Recently, on February 21, the top court had directed the Centre and state governments to comply within a month with its directions on mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in police stations and offices of investigation agencies while clarifying that in case of non-compliance, it would be compelled to take necessary steps against the officials concerned.Before the high court, besides functional CCTVs, petitioner Chandril Dabas had also sought directions to ensure that the footage is stored at least for a minimum period of one year or eighteen months.The petitioner, represented by lawyer Manan Aggarwal, said in his petition that in June 2021, he was harassed and threatened by certain police officials after he was found without an e-pass issued for movement during the COVID-19 pandemic.He claimed in the plea that he explained to the police that he was going to his workplace to get the documents for issuance of an e-pass but he was taken to the concerned police station and made to sign some papers.It was the petitioner's grievance that when he approached the trial court for initiation of action against the erring officials and sought preservation of CCTV footage, the police claimed that the CCTV footage in question could not be preserved as the backup was only for eighteen days and the camera covering the open area of the police station was also not functional.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe petition thus argued that such a situation is in violation of a Supreme Court decision which directed that CCTV footage in all police stations must be stored for a period of at least 18 months.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

(Representational)New Delhi:Stakes are high for the BJP ahead of the counting of votes on Thursday for three state assembly polls as results will signal if it has deepened its roots in Tripura, a Left bastion captured by the party in 2018, and made further inroads in Meghalaya and Nagaland, or the opposition has managed to dent its influence.Among the three states, it is Tripura which promises to have more national resonance than the two others as traditional rivals Congress and the Left have joined hands for the first time to challenge the BJP in the election to the state's 60-member assembly.In this battle among the national parties, it is the Pradyot Debbarma-led TIPRA Motha that has emerged as an X-factor as the sway of its founder, scion of erstwhile royalty, among a big section of the tribal population has disturbed conventional calculations, more so as the BJP and its ally Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) had done well in the tribal region in 2018.The BJP had won 36 seats and the IPFT eight last time. With the IPFT in decline following the death of its founder N C Debbarma, the burden of delivering a majority rests largely on the shoulders of the BJP while its two main rivals have united.The BJP's stunning rise after having failed to win a single seat in 2013 to a majority on its own five years later by decimating the Left citadel for two decades was projected by the party as its ideological victory over its rivals, and a loss will be seen as a setback despite Tripura's relatively marginal influence on national politics.While regional parties remain bigger players in both Meghalaya and Nagaland, the BJP ran a determined campaign with its bigwigs, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, in the states to expand its footprints.For the first time, the BJP has fought on all 60 seats in Meghalaya and constantly targeted National People's Party leader and Chief Minister Conrad Sangma for running the \"most corrupt\" state government in the country.The BJP was a partner in the state government but broke ties ahead of the polls. The party hopes to boost its strength from two in the assembly to emerge as a more powerful player if the verdict throws up a hung assembly like the last time.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the BJP's pointsman for the northeast region, met Mr Sangma after the polls in an indication that the two parties can do business together again.An interesting sideshow to these election is the strong push by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress to make an impact in the polls to project itself as a stronger challenger to the BJP than the Congress, more so as the countdown to the next Lok Sabha polls in 2024 begins.The Congress has also run an intensive campaign, with Rahul Gandhi holding a rally in Meghalaya, in its bid to claw back its lost influence in the states it once dominated.In Nagaland, which had the unique feature of having no opposition as all parties with presence in the 60-member assembly backed the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party-led government, the BJP is again fighting the polls in alliance with the NDPP.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMr Sarma has claimed that there will be no hung assembly in Tripura, Nagaland or Meghalaya, as predicted in some exit polls, and the BJP-led NDA will form governments with absolute majority in all three northeastern states.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

All these downings took place along the international border in Punjab.While one drone each was shot down in Punjab and Jammu during the entire 2020 and 2021, six have been brought down or seized by the force till February 20 this year. Out of the six drones caught during 2023, four captures were made in Punjab and the rest in Rajasthan.According to official data, the drone sightings along the 2,289 km long India-Pakistan international border running along Jammu, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat have increased from 77 sightings in 2020 to 104 in 2021 and more than 311 sightings during last year. Almost 75 per cent of these sightings have been made in Punjab where drones have been majorly used by the other side to push in and drop drugs and arms.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe BSF has earlier said a number of the drones shot or recovered were made in China.

        "text": "Chennai:Hundreds of supporters and a few opposition leaders, carrying flowers and gifts, lined up in Chennai today to greet Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin on his 70th birthday. The gifts included an unorthodox one -- a young camel that lumbered around. A party worker walked it to the hall where the DMK chief met the party cadre.The expected opposition show of strength, though, is yet to materialise. There has been expectation that the galvanization of the opposition following the arrest of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in connection with the alleged liquor scam, will lead to some concrete steps. Barring the Congress, which took a nuanced position, all opposition parties have slammed the arrest.Only four leaders are present at the event -- Congress's Mallikarjun Kharge, National Conference patriarch Farooq Abdullah, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Tejashwi Yadav, and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.The list of negative RSVP to the DMK invite included Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who decided to skip event as his birthday falls on the same day. Nationalist Congress chief Sharad Pawar, a Congress ally in Maharashtra, has cited poor health.The list of opposition leaders missing was longer, laying bare the chinks in the opposition unity ahead of next year's general election.It included Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been keeping a low profile since the Presidential election. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal were not invited out of \"mutual understanding\".All three leaders are seen as aspirants for the post of the Prime Minister, which has proved the biggest hurdle in bringing the opposition under one umbrella. DMK spokesperson TKS Elangovan, however, said, \"Invites were sent only to those who were available to join today\".In 2019, Mr Stalin had proposed Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the opposition, upsetting several leaders. This time, Farooq Abdullah said, \"We should decide on the best man for PM after the elections. Now we should all fight together\".He was seconded by Mallikarjun Kharge. \"We are not naming a PM candidate,\" the new Congress chief said. \"We are not telling who will lead. We want to fight together. All like-minded opposition parties must come together in this fight against divisive forces. We should continue to strengthen our alliance ahead of 2024 polls,\" he added.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Hollow supremacy can be fought only with the collective will of people... Stalin's leadership draws from illustrious leadership of Karunannidhi, Anna Durai and Periyar. Parties in north India should rele arn social justice from Tamil Nadu,\" said Tejashwi Yadav.\"On issues like GST, CAA, all these parties are already opposing ideologically. Of course, the political alliance will be stitched after elections are announced. But already all are working in tandem,\" said DMK spokesperson Manu Sundaram.",

(File)New Delhi:The heart of a 32-year-old man who died in a road accident was donated to a patient after the organ was ferried through a 10-kilometre 'green corridor' set up between a private hospital here and the AIIMS on Wednesday, hospital authorities said.The victim was brought in an \"extremely critical condition\" at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, following a road accident on the morning of February 25. His CT examination revealed \"severe brain damage\", doctors said.Despite the best efforts of a team of doctors, the patient could not be saved. After he was declared brain dead, his family consented to donating his organs, a Fortis Hospital spokesperson said.The organs were retrieved on Wednesday and sent to three different hospitals. One of his kidneys was used for a patient at the hospital, she said.The heart was donated to a patient at AIIMS, the liver to one at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here and a kidney to a patient at Max Hospital in Delhi's Shalimar Bagh, Fortis Hospital said in a statement.A green corridor was set up from Fortis Hospital to transport the harvested heart to AIIMS, covering the 10-kilometre distance in just 11 minutes, it said.\"A transplant surgery for the patient who has received the donated heart is still underway at AIIMS,\" the spokesperson said.A 61-old-old Delhi woman suffering from renal failure was the recipient of a kidney. The transplant is over, she said.Dr Gauri Shankar Sharma, director and head of critical care medicine at Fortis Hospital, said, \"The clockwork precision of all internal and external teams, including Delhi Traffic Police, made this donation a reality. This should encourage more people to come forward and get themselves registered for organ donation to save more lives.\"According to data available with the National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), 11 cadaver donations were done with successful retrieval of 30 organs in Delhi in 2022, the statement said.Every year, hundreds of people die waiting for an organ transplant in India. Due to misconceptions and the lack of awareness, there is a shortage of organ donors, doctors said.The gap between the number of organs donated and the people waiting for a transplant is growing wider with each passing year. Timely cadaveric organ donation can save many lives and more people would come forward and pledge their organs if they receive more information and are educated on the benefits of organ donation, they said.In another development, doctors at Max Super Speciality Hospital in Saket removed \"bilateral adrenal tumours\" the size of a \"large watermelon\" on the right side and a \"football-size tumour\" on the left side from the abdomen of a 51-year-old man, doctors said.They have claimed that the case made for \"the world's largest adrenal tumours removed so far\".The tumours were so huge that they made the patient's abdomen protrude outwards and had displaced internal organs around them, the doctors at the hospital here said.The tumours, measuring 20 x 20 cm (right side) and 12 x 10 cm (left side), and weighing 4.5 kg and 1 kg, respectively, were located deep in the upper part of the abdomen at the top of the kidney where the adrenal is situated. Adrenal glands normally measure about 2 cm in an adult, the hospital said in a statement.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe patient, Bivash Chandra Tivari from Bihar, was presented to the hospital with complaints of loss of appetite, constipation for 2-2.5 months and abdominal distention.

The liquor scam, he declared, \"is an excuse\" and if Manish Sisodia joins the BJP, \"he would be free by tomorrow\".\"Corruption is not the issue. The motive was to stop the good work done by the ministers,\" Mr Kejriwal said in his first interaction with the media since Mr Sisodia's arrest.Mr Sisodia, the face of AAP government's work in health and education, was arrested on Sunday in connection with the alleged liquor scam. He has been named as the accused number one in the case. He has already stepped down as minister. The 18 portfolios he was handling have been divided up between two of the remaining five ministers.\"The BJP wants to stop AAP.

        "text": "JP Nadda with Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and other leaders at 'Vijay Sankalp Yatra'Bengaluru:With strong anti-incumbency fuelled by a raft of corruption allegations in Karnataka, the BJP is now focusing on the region which has been the stronghold of its rival Janata Dal (Secular) or JDS - Chamrajanagar district in the Old Mysuru Region - for the election due later this year.BJP Chief JP Nadda today flagged off the party's first election campaign, \"Vijay Sankalp Yatra\" - first among the four plannedyatrasfrom the four corners of the state - from Hanur assembly seat.The Old Mysore Region, with 61 assembly seats, is a stronghold of the JDS. The Congress has also been a major force in the area.In 2018, the BJP did exceptionally well in coastal Karnataka and the Mumbai-Karnataka regions. However, it fell short of a clear majority in parts of the old Mysuru region and the Hyderabad-Karnataka region.\"It's been almost impossible for the BJP to claim victory in the Old Mysuru region. To strengthen the base, they have begun the yatra from here. The focus is, of course, to strengthen the Nanjangud and Gundlupet assembly seats. And more importantly, the Chamarajanagar assembly seat where we lacked support. Further, we will slowly move into Mysuru, Mandya and Nanjungudu,\" said BJP spokesperson S Prakash.Chamarajanagar is one among the nine districts of the Old Mysore Region that includes Mysuru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Bengaluru Rural, Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, and Hassan districts. It has four assembly segments - Hanur, Chamarajanagar, Kollegal and Gundlupet.Why Chamarajanar was the choice of the BJP to flag off the yatra?In Hanur, the BJP has found it challenging to defeat the Congress's three-time MLA R Narendra from the Vokkaliga community while in Chamarajanagar assembly seat, Congress' C Puttarangashetty from the OBC community won in the 2018 assembly election.In 2018, Mr Puttarangashetty scored a hattrick by defeating BJP's KR Mallikarjunappa with a margin of 4,913 votes. He was the winner from the seat in the 2013 and 2008 elections too.\"Mr Puttarangashetty has been facing a strong anti-incumbency wave. A poor performance in the assembly could spell trouble for the Congress, at a time when the BJP is trying hard to shift the Congress votes with pro-development promises. Observing the performance of the BJP MLAs and gauging the pulse of the people, the BJP has decided to launch their election campaign from Chamarajanagar district today,\" a poll strategist with the Congress told NDTV.Highly placed sources in the BJP told NDTV: \"In three of the four assembly seats in Chamarajanagar district, the BJP is looking to field candidates from the Lingayat community while the fourth seat - Kollegal - has been reserved for the candidate from Scheduled Caste community\".The BJP is now focusing on consolidating the Lingayat and tribal votes that are more concentrated in the Chamarajanagar district.\"The votes from the tribal community were split between the Congress and the BJP. There is a right-wing tilt among the younger generation of the Vokkaliga community. The outreach by local BJP leaders look great and they are ahead of all political parties,\" added a political analyst with the Congress.The Congress is now banking on Siddaramaiah and its Karnataka Pradesh Committee's working president R Dhruvanarayan, who lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election by a whisker to BJP's V Srinivas Prasad.The Congress had in January launched a march - Prajadhwani Yatra - which traversed across the Mysuru-Chamarajanagar-Mandya belt, highlighting the BJP is occupied with the construction of temples instead of working on pro-development schemes.The BJP recently announced that it would construct a Ram temple in Ramanagara district in the region.Inspired by Rahul Gandhi's 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' in Karnataka, the Prajadhwani Yatra is headed by two teams - one by Siddaramaiah who is currently touring assembly constituencies in north Karnataka and another team by DK Shivakumar who has been focusing on the southern districts.\"With BJP sidelining BS Yediyurappa, the only USP for the party right now is to capitalise on their central leaders' visit and by taking advantage of V Sommanna - the sitting MLA and Minister for Housing who has a huge Lingayat following. In Chamarajanagar, if you have money, poll fortunes can change and it's visible with the BJP,\" said a Congress political observer.Mysuru BJP MP Pratap Simha said the BJP is in a tight spot because they have no big face in the old Mysuru region which has put them on the back foot\"BJP was never there in the Old Mysuru Region. We were never able to make inroads in there. Since 2019 - through development, we are winning. During the previous election, BJP won only 16 of the 61 seats. Most of the seats in the old Mysuru region have gone to the Congress and JD(S) and the BJP is trying hard to squeeze in. If we get at least 25-30 seats in the Old Mysuru Region, we will have an absolute majority,\" said Mr Simha\"The BJP never had a state-level leadership and a big name in the Old Mysuru Region. The Congress and the JDS always had leaders like SM Krishna, Devraj Urs, Deve Gowda but the BJP never had a tall leader from the region. Most of the leaders in the Congress and JDS have been from the Vokkaliga community. Without Vokkaligas voters, a win is difficult in the old Mysuru region. However, in the last few years, a few leaders from the community have joined the BJP. In the present state government, prominent leaders from the Vokkaliga community are ministers. We are also attracting voters with pro-development schemes like the upcoming inauguration of the Mysuru expressway, drinking water under the Jal Jeevan mission. People are slowly tilting toward BJP because of the development schemes we are offering,\" he added.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe party is banking on central leaders and the star power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the assembly election. Tomorrow, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will flag off the second Yatra from Nandagarh in Belagavi.

        "text": "The teen's family was informed by friends, rather than the college, about his death.Hyderabad:On Tuesday evening, a 16-year-old told his father he was struggling at the residential college he joined less than a year ago - the pressure was too much, he said. It was a cry for help. His father, who visited the hostel to hand him his anti-allergy medicine, cajoled him to stay put.Hours later, the Class 11 student was found hanging in a classroom at the junior college in Narsingi near Hyderabad.Like every day at this college for IIT aspirants, the students had study hour till 10 pm. When they left for their rooms in the hostel, this boy was missing.His friends informed the warden but decided to look for him when they realised no one was reacting fast. They frantically searched room to room. They finally found him in a classroom. They ran carrying him, hailed a lift and rushed to a hospital. No one from the faculty came to help, the students claim. He was declared dead in hospital.At 4 am, all students were sent home for two days.The students handed over to the police a crumpled suicide note they had found the teen clutching.\"I am not able to cope with this, Amma. That's why I am doing this wrong deed. Please forgive me,\" said the handwritten \"suicide letter\".\"No one should suffer the torture I am going through. Please ensure they are punished...\"The note was full of apologies to his family - his parents, elder brother, even friends. \"Sorry for subjecting you to this, Amma,\" he wrote and asked his brother to look after her well, so she would not miss him.Classmates said the boy was under extreme pressure and had grown distant, of late.\"The main reason is the pressure put on him. With the idea that he should get more marks, they tortured him. These days he was a little depressed and distant from us... The pressure put by college is responsible for whatever happened,'' said one of his friends.Some students shared videos that suggest the boys were subjected to physical assault and public humiliation over studies at the college that specialises in intense IIT coaching for Class 11 and 12 students.A punishing schedule did not help. The students say they are expected to start the day at 5 am and go through a whirl of classes and studies, only pausing for breakfast, lunch and dinner. After attending classes till 10 pm, they are often up till midnight to prepare for tests.Those who didn't do well were humiliated, students claimed, alleging a \"caste system\" based on grades.The teen's family was informed by friends, rather than the college, about his death.\"Even when the boys informed that our boy was missing, they did not react for more than 15 minutes. Very irresponsible,'' said the boy's uncle.Telangana Education Minister Sabita Indra Reddy said she would investigate and take action.On whether she had noted the alleged videos of beatings, she said: \"Definitely, this is unacceptable even in school. How can it happen in a college. I saw the videos. We will get this inquired into.''The police have charged the college authorities with abetment to suicide. Four people named by the family and students are being questioned.Telangana has been jolted by student suicides in the past week.An engineering student hanged herself in Warangal on Sunday after a friend leaked her personal photos.Another woman from Warangal, a postgraduate medical student who had attempted suicide on Wednesday, over alleged harassment by a senior, died at a Hyderabad hospital on Sunday.A final-year medical student died by suicide at her hostel room in Nizamabad last Saturday.Another student died by suicide at a relative's home last week.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comAs many as 1,64,033 people died by suicide in the country in 2021, according to the latest official figures.HelplinesVandrevala Foundation for Mental Health9999666555orhelp@vandrevalafoundation.comTISS iCall022-25521111(Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)",

The tenth schedule will also operate even if they are all in the party and it makes no difference to the tenth schedule as to who remains in the minority, the bench remarked.Senior Advocate Kaul said that as far as the tenth schedule is concerned, an attempt is made to say that this is only the legislature party and not the political party.Kaul said that he never said that the two are different but the argument is that this decision has the authority of the political party.Kaul insisted that ECI has to decide which is the rival section in the recognized political party and its decision shall be binding.Kaul also highlighted that their camp always claimed that they are the same Shiv Sena party and never claimed that they are a new original political party.Kual submitted that when the Uddhav camp sensed the dissent and knew that many leaders are not supporting him, they went to the speaker and filed a disqualification petition and hence a trust vote which should happen immediately did not happen.But the court noted that Uddhav Camp are right to the extent that the request to swear in Eknath Shinde as the Chief Minister and the opportunity given to him to prove his majority, came into being only because the speaker could not disqualify Shinde.The hearing remained inconclusive today and would be continued tomorrow as well.A five-judge Constitution bench was hearing a batch of petitions filed by rival factions Uddhav Thackeray and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde in relation to the Maharashtra political crisis.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe Supreme Court's Constitution bench has earlier said it will decide later on referring the cases related to the Maharashtra political crisis to a larger seven-judge bench for reconsideration of a 2016 Nabam Rebia judgment on powers of Assembly Speakers to deal with disqualification pleas.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The two countries have held 17 rounds of high-level military commanders' talks to resolve the standoff.Beijing:Ahead of an expected meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in New Delhi on Thursday, China said on Wednesday that it \"values\" its ties with India and a \"sound relationship\" between the two is in the fundamental interests of both countries and its people.Qin, who is visiting New Delhi to attend the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting on Thursday, is expected to meet Jaishankar on its sidelines.Termed as a \"fence-mending\" visit to India by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper, this is Qin's first visit to India after he took over the post from his predecessor Wang Yi in December last and it is also his first meeting with Jaishankar.Significance is attached to Qin and Jaishankar's meeting in light of progress made by the two countries in the 17 rounds of high-level military-level talks to resolve the eastern Ladakh standoff.Asked about Qin's meeting with Jaishankar, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a media briefing here on Wednesday that \"China values its relations with India\".\"China and India are ancient civilisations and both have more than one billion people. We are neighbours and are both emerging economies. A sound China-India relationship meets the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples,\" she said.Details of Qin's visit to India will be released in a timely manner , Mao said without confirming a meeting with Jaishankar.Relations between China and India have virtually frozen ever since the eastern Ladakh military standoff between the two countries in May 2020.The two countries have held 17 rounds of high-level military commanders' talks to resolve the standoff.India has been maintaining that its ties with China cannot be normal unless there is peace in the border areas.Last week, senior officials from India and China held an in-person meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) here and discussed proposals for disengagement in the remaining areas of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.This was the first in-person meeting of the WMCC since July 2019. Joint Secretary (East Asia) of the Ministry of External Affairs Dr Shilpak Ambule, who headed the Indian delegation, also called on Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying.Commenting on Qin's visit, Wang Dehua, head of the Institute for South and Central Asia Studies at the Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said the Chinese Foreign Minister's visit to Delhi could help ease bilateral tensions over the prolonged border stand-off between China and India.\"It is an important move for bilateral ties and although it's impossible to see a breakthrough in their border disputes any time soon, it will at least help repair their damaged ties and stabilise the situation near the disputed areas,\" he told the Post.According to Wang, the Modi government appears to partly share Beijing's concerns and also wants to avoid having the Ukraine crisis dominate the G20 gatherings this year, which could give Beijing an opportunity to seek common ground with Delhi.With the border dispute remaining the top challenge for bilateral ties, it would be difficult to expect to see a rapid improvement in those relations between India and China.\"While Beijing still sees Delhi as a swing country in the US-China rivalry, Delhi is actively trying to forge partnerships with various countries, including the US, the UK, Japan, and other Western powers (to counterbalance China),\" he said.India assumed the Presidency of the G20 on December 1, last year.

        "text": "New Delhi:The resignation of two of its ministers, including Manish Sisodia, amid allegations of graft, has thrown a new challenge for the AAP with its rivals using the development to discredit the party's key poll plank of \"Kejriwal model of governance\".Mr Sisodia, who was handling 18 of the total 33 departments in the Delhi government, was arrested on Sunday by the CBI in the Delhi excise policy scam case, while Satyendra Jain, currently lodged in Tihar jail, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in May last year in connection with a money laundering case. They both resigned of Tuesday.The development comes at a time when the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is gearing up to contest all the seats in the assembly elections to be held in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, keeping its \"Delhi model of governance\" as one of the key planks for the polls.AAP leaders said the party has become stronger whenever it has been attacked and accused the BJP government of running a \"witch-hunt\" against its leaders.Mr Sisodia, sources in party said, besides being the deputy chief minister, had finance, education and public works portfolios, ministries key to the Kejriwal model.The AAP leadership has \"already\" asked the party's state units to \"intensify\" their campaign against the BJP and the Congress in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan which will go to polls this year, the sources said.The party will turn the table on the BJP with a massive counter-campaign highlighting a range of issues, including allegations of stock manipulation by the Adani Group and the alleged misuse of central probe agencies by its government at the Centre, they said.The AAP is under attack by the BJP since the CBI registered a case in connection with alleged irregularities in the implementation and formulation of the excise policy, now withdrawn, against 15 accused, including Manish Sisodia, who was deputy chief minister.\"The AAP has become stronger whenever it has been attacked and efforts have been made to crush the party. The AAP survived even when it was nothing. Today, we have our government in two states and our members in two other state assemblies,\" AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj told PTI.He dubbed Sisodia's arrest by the CBI as political vendetta and accused the Modi government of running \"an organised witch-hunt\" of the AAP leaders.An AAP leader also claimed that the resignations by Sisodia and Jain, who are victims of political vendetta, has taken the fizz off the BJP campaign against the party. Bharadwaj also took on the Congress, saying leaders of the grand old party, who used to call \"AAP a B-Team of the BJP and Kejriwal as Modi's 'younger brother'\", have gone into \"hibernation\" today.\"There are a litany of allegations against Rahul Gandhi but he is roaming scot free, taking out Bharat Jodo Yatra while we are facing a continuous attack,\" he said.\"This has sent out one message that the BJP considers AAP its number one enemy. That's why it keeps making attempts to crush the AAP,\" he said.Riding high on its electoral success in Punjab and gains in Gujarat and Goa last year, the AAP is gearing up to contest in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan even though it had failed to open its account in the last assembly elections in these states.While the AAP stormed to power in Punjab in March last year, it also managed to breach the BJP bastion of Gujarat by winning five seats with a nearly 13 per cent vote share in the polls held in December.The AAP also gained a toehold in Goa, winning two assembly seats in the coastal state last year. The electoral gains in these three states also paved the way for the AAP to get recognised by the Election Commission (EC) as a national party.Mr Kejriwal is scheduled to visit these four states to launch his party's foray ahead of elections.While Mr Kejriwal is scheduled to launch his party's poll campaign in BJP-ruled Karnataka on March 4, he will visit Chhattisgarh and sound the AAP's poll bugle in the Congress-ruled state on March 5.The AAP supremo will launch his poll campaign in Rajasthan, currently ruled by the Congress, on March 13, and in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh on March 14.\"There is no change in the schedule so far. Kejriwal ji will visit Chhattisgarh on March 5,\" AAP in-charge of the state Sanjeev Jha, who is camping there for more than a month to lead the party's poll preparations, told PTI.\"There is no impact on the party's poll prospects with the arrest of Sisodia as he is a man with a clean image, known for the revolutionary transformation that he brought in school education in Delhi,\" he said.

It had upset key opposition leaders, especially the ones with Prime Ministerial ambitions. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her Telangana counterpart K Chandrashekar Rao are two of the cases in point.This time, with 2024 elections round the corner and with other alliance partners like Nitish Kumar asking it to take the lead, the Congress passed a resolution on Saturday, the final day of the plenary session in Raipur.In the resolution, the Congress had called for unity of secular and socialist forces, but remained silent on taking the lead. It was seen as a key climbdown to ensure there are no stumbling blocks in seat adjustments.The idea of a united front against the BJP took a beating in 2019, with Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee and Mr Rao making clear their antipathy about a Congress leadership. Mr Rao, in fact, dubbed Rahul Gandhi \"a buffoon\", bringing much cheer to the BJP camp, which thought they were on the threshold of gaining an ally.Mayawati and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav could not be brought on board either, with the seat sharing talks for the assembly elections falling through months before. Akhilesh Yadav had said he was \"thankful\" that there's no alliance with the Congress. \"It is because of their faulty policies that the BJP is in power today,\" he had said.The divide in the Opposition camp brought bigger returns for the BJP, which had time and again taunted the Opposition, saying if they ever came to power, they would have a different Prime Minister for every day of the week.The election pushed the BJP score to above 300, from the 282 seats it won in 2014. The Congress ended up with a second crushing defeat in a row, leading to Mr Gandhi stepping down from the party's top post and the eventual election of a non-Gandhi to it.In his message, Mr Stalin, a staunch ally of the Congress, made it clear that an opposition alliance without the Congress \"will not work\".PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"The loss is ours if we decide our national politics on the basis of political differences between states. Political parties should rise above differences and stand together as a unified force to defeat the BJP,\" he said.To that end, \"Non-Congress initiatives will not work. Post-poll alliance will not work too. Talks of Third Front is pointless -- parties opposed to the BJP should understand this simple arithmetic,\" he added.",

        "text": "A five-judge Supreme Court bench is hearing the matter. (File)New Delhi:Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde could not have been sworn in as the chief minister of Maharashtra if the assembly speaker was not restrained from deciding the disqualification petitions pending against 39 MLAs, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said.The Shinde faction told the court that even if 39 MLAs would have been disqualified from the assembly, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would have fallen because it had lost majority and the then chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had resigned before the floor test.The Thackeray faction had earlier told the court that the formation of a new government in Maharashtra under Shinde was the \"direct and inevitable result\" of two orders of the Supreme Court dated June 27, 2022 (restraining the speaker from deciding the pending disqualification petitions) and June 29, 2022 (allowing the trust vote to be held) and had \"disturbed the co-equal and mutual balance\" between judicial and legislative organs of the State.A five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud told senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for Shinde bloc, \"They (Uddhav faction) are right to this extent that Eknath Shinde was sworn in as chief minister by the governor and was able to prove his majority because the speaker was not able to proceed with the disqualification proceedings against him and other MLAs.\" Mr Kaul said that just after June 29, 2022, Mr Thackeray had resigned because he knew that he did not have a majority and in the floor test held on July 4, last year, his coalition had got only 99 votes as 13 of MVA legislators had abstained from voting.On July 4, last year, Mr Shinde had won the crucial floor test in the state assembly with the support of BJP and independents. In the 288-member House, 164 MLAs had voted for the motion of confidence, while 99 voted against it.Mr Kaul said, \"They (Thackeray faction) knew that they did not have a majority and even his 13 MLAs, who were earlier supporting them had abstained from voting in floor test. Shinde and other MLAs could not have been disqualified as the 2016 Nabam Rebia verdict of the top court would have come into play, which said that the Speaker could not decide on the disqualification petitions, if a motion for his removal was pending. Until he is disqualified, he continues to be the member of the house.\"The bench after perusing a chart of voting in floor test given by Mr Kaul said that even if the court assumed that 2016 Nabam Rebia verdict did not exist, the speaker would have proceeded to disqualify those MLAs but yes, even if they had been disqualified, even then the government would have fallen.Mr Kaul said, \"Exactly. The chief minister had resigned before the floor test and the combination which came forward before the governor was asked by him to prove his majority on the floor of the house. I say, what is wrong in it? What else could he (governor) have done.\" At the outset, Mr Kaul submitted that Shinde faction was never against Thackeray but was against the party continuing in the MVA and even their resolution dated June 21, 2022 said that there was widespread discontent among cadres.\"Our case was never that we were against the then chief minister but we were against the MVA coalition. Shiv Sena had a pre-poll alliance with BJP and after the election, we formed a government with the help of the NCP and Congress, against whom we contested the election. We said in our resolution that there was widespread discontent among party workers,\" he said.He submitted that the Uddhav faction has tried to confuse powers of three constitutional authorities - Governor, Speaker and the Election Commission - and now want that everything should be set aside including July 4, last year floor test. \"Legislative party is an integral part of the original political party. We have raised our voice in the party. The very act of filing disqualification petitions with the speaker by them (Uddhav faction) was to stifle dissent. Internal dissent within the party does not qualify for disqualification under the tenth schedule,\" Mr Kaul submitted.The hearing remained inconclusive and would continue on Thursday.On Tuesday, the court had asked the Shinde-led faction if its move to go against the Shiv Sena party's wish to continue with the coalition in the MVA amounted to indiscipline leading to disqualification.Defending its stand, the Shinde faction said the legislative party is an integral part of the original political party and informed that there were two whips appointed by the party in June last year and it went with the one that said it did not want to continue in the coalition.On February 23, the Uddhav faction told the court that the formation of a new government in Maharashtra under Mr Shinde was the \"direct and inevitable result\" of two orders of the court that \"disturbed the co-equal and mutual balance\" between judicial and legislative organs of the State.A political crisis had erupted in Maharashtra after an open revolt in the Sena and, on June 29, 2022, the court refused to stay the Maharashtra governor's direction to the 31-month-old MVA government to take a floor test in the assembly to prove its majority.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOn August 23, 2022, a three-judge bench of the top court headed by then chief justice N V Ramana had formulated several questions of law and referred to the five-judge bench petitions filed by the two Sena factions which raised several constitutional questions related to defection, merger and disqualification.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

(Representational)New Delhi:The Congress on Wednesday hit out at the government over the hike in price of LPG cylinders, saying if it comes to power at the Centre, it would end the \"loot\" by providing cylinders for domestic users under Rs 500.Cooking gas LPG price on Wednesday was hiked by Rs 50 per cylinder -- the first increase in rates in almost eight months -- that came within days of end of polling in three northeastern states and was sharply criticised by the Opposition.In Delhi, a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder now costs Rs 1,103, up from Rs 1,053, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the price of domestic cooking gas cylinder has been raised by Rs 50 and that of commercial gas cylinder by Rs 350 at a time when every person in the country is facing the brunt of high inflation.\"The public is asking - how to make Holi dishes now, for how long will these orders of loot continue? Every person is facing the brunt of back-breaking inflation implemented by (Narendra) Modi government,\" Mr Kharge said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in \"mitra kaal\" the pockets of the public are being cut and those of \"friends\" being filled.Comparing the price of LPG cylinders during the Congress' tenure in 2014 and that of the BJP, he said while the price of a cylinder was Rs 410, the subsidy was of Rs 827, while under the BJP in 2023, the price of a LPG cylinder is Rs 1,103 and subsidy is nil.\"In the Congress era there was relief in the form of subsidy, during 'mitra kaal' only the pockets of the public are cut and the country's wealth is distributed to 'Mitra' (friends) in charity,\" Mr Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.Party spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh said Prime Minister Modi has given a Holi \"gift\" to the people in the form of the LPG price hike.If the Congress comes to power at the Centre, it would provide gas cylinders under Rs 500 on the lines of that provided by its government in Rajasthan, he said.\"If the Congress comes to power, the party pledges to provide domestic LPG cylinders at below Rs 500 as being provided by the Rajasthan government. PM Modi ji should draw lessons from the Congress government in Rajasthan and not loot the people of the country with high taxes,\" Mr Vallabh told reporters.He added that any hike in prices has a cascading effect on all articles.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the BJP government has again increased the prices of cylinders and this time just before Holi.\"Since 2014, the government has raised the price of cylinders by 275 per cent. The cylinder was Rs 400 in the Congress government, the Congress government of Rajasthan is providing cylinders for Rs 500. The prime minister should tell, then why is your government looting the public like this,\" Priyanka Gandhi asked.Senior Congress leader from Haryana Deepender Singh Hooda said instead of giving relief from inflation, this \"arrogant government is inflicting economic pain on the common, poor and middle class at every step\".\"When gas cylinder's cost was Rs 350 during the UPA government, BJP leaders had come on the streets with cylinders on their heads, their photos are still available on social media. Now even after the price of cylinder has crossed Rs 1,100, BJP leaders have gone on mute mode,\" the Rajya Sabha MP said.He demanded the government withdraw the price hike immediately and said \"when the Congress government comes to power, it will be ensured that (domestic) consumers do not have to pay more than Rs 500 for cooking gas (cylinder)\".Punjab Congress chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said the steep hike in price of LPG cylinders shows the \"anti-common people mindset\" of the BJP government at the Centre.\"The income of common people is decreasing, they are not getting employment, their savings are getting exhausted and the government is imposing burden, so that no one can lead a happy life,\" Mr Warring said in a tweet in Hindi.In the hike in prices, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) said Rs 1,103 was the rate for a 14.2-kg non-subsidised LPG cylinder.The government doesn't pay any subsidy to most non-Ujjwala users and this is the rate that they will have to pay for buying cooking gas refills.The government pays Rs 200 per cylinder subsidy to the 9.58 crore poor who got free LPG connection under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. The effective price for them would be Rs 903 per cylinder.State-owned fuel retailers are supposed to revise rates on a monthly basis in line with cost but they have not done so since 2020 and were in October last year given a one-time grant of Rs 22,000 crore to make up for losses they incurred between June 2020 and June 2022.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThey last revised domestic LPG price on July 4 last year.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "His plea comes on a day a BJP MP indirectly warned of such a possibility.New Delhi/Prayagraj:Gangster-turned-politician Atiq Ahmed on Wednesday sought protection from the Supreme court saying he feared being killed in a fake encounter by the Uttar Pradesh Police, days after a key witness in the 2005 Raju Pal murder and his two security guards were gunned down.His plea comes on a day a BJP MP indirectly warned of such a possibility. Also on Wednesday, the house of an Atiq Ahmed aide - where the politician also stayed earlier - was bulldozed by municipal authorities in Prayagraj, citing a civic law violation.The former Samajwadi Party MP, who is lodged at a Gujarat jail, said the UP Police in all likelihood will seek his remand to take him to Prayagraj.He \"genuinely apprehends that he may be eliminated during this transit period\", the plea filed in the Supreme Court said, seeking directions to the Centre and the state government to ensure his security.On Twitter, Subrat Pathak, the BJP MP from Kannauj, recalled the 2020 death of gangster Vikas Dubey in an alleged exchange of fire with policemen who were accompanying him. The car carrying them had overturned, according to the police version.Pathak called the killing of Umesh Pal and the police personnel \"a direct attack\" on Uttar Pradesh government.\"Remember, when Vikas Dubey didn't survive, it is not necessary to tell what would happen to these evil people,\" he tweeted in Hindi. \"And I would not be surprised at all if Atiq's car too overturns now.\" Last Friday, Umesh Pal, the prime witness in the 2005 murder of Bahujan Samaj Party MLA Raju Pal, was shot dead in UP's Prayagraj. Two policemen assigned to protect him also succumbed to their injuries - the second one only on Wednesday.When the Umesh Pal killing figured in the state assembly on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said gangsters will be ground into the dust. \"Mitti mein mela denge,\" he had said in Hindi.On Monday, Arbaaz, an accused in the Umesh Pal murder was killed in a police encounter in Prayagraj. Atiq Ahmed, accused in the 2005 case, is also booked in the Umesh Pal murder case.In his plea, Atiq Khan, 61, referred to Adityanath's statement in the assembly and claimed there is a \"genuine and perceptible threat\" to him and his family members.He claimed they have all been falsely roped in by the UP Police in the Umesh Pal case. It seemed that a conspiracy has been hatched to wipe them out politically as well physically, the petition said.It alleged that Ahmed's two minor sons have already been taken into \"illegal custody\" by police and kept at an undisclosed location.\"It is even unknown to the petitioner whether they are dead or alive. The other two sons of the petitioner are also in jail in other false cases,\" it said, adding that the petitioner fears that they may be killed in a fake encounter.Ahmed sought directions to the Centre, state of Uttar Pradesh and others to protect his life against the \"open, direct and immediate threat\" to his life from high state functionaries of Uttar Pradesh.The petition said the opposition added fuel to the fire in the state assembly, provoking the CM to make his \"mafia ko mitti mein mila doonga\" remark, when Atiq Ahmed was \"main subject\" of the discussion.\"Petitioner genuinely apprehends and believes that the petitioner may be killed in a fake encounter on one pretext or the other by UP police particularly in view of the statement made by the chief minister of state of UP on the floor of the house,\" the plea alleged.He has sought directions restraining the state of Uttar Pradesh and others from taking him from Ahmedabad to Prayagraj or any part of Uttar Pradesh. His interrogation, if any, should be carried out at the Central Jail where he is lodged or at any other suitable place in Ahmedabad itself under the protection of Gujarat Police as well as central or paramilitary forces, the plea said.If the transit to Prayagraj is at all necessary, it should be under the protection of any central or paramilitary force, he has asked.Ahmed also sought a direction allowing his advocate to remain present during his interrogation and to quash warrants, if issued by any court, for taking him to Prayagraj from the Ahmedabad prison.Ahmed pleaded that he and his family members have no connection to the Umesh Pal murder and were named in the FIR due to political and other reasons.The main reason seems to be that his wife has joined the BSP and the party declared her as a candidate for the post of mayor in the coming election, the petition claimed.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"It was very well known to the rivals of the petitioner that if anything were to happen to Umesh Pal, then the petitioner would certainly be the prime suspect in view of the pending case against him by Umesh Pal and he will be made an accused. The same has been done,\" it said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Above-normal temperatures along with heat wave conditions are expected in most parts of India.India's thriving farm sector - the only bright spot in its slowing economy - has become a hostage to warnings of a heat wave, muddling the outlook for policy makers already grappling with sticky inflation.The nation's economic growth unexpectedly slowed to a three-quarter low of 4.4% in three months to December, data showed Tuesday. The weather office's prediction of a hotter summer compounded the concerns, throwing a fresh challenge before the central bank that's already struggling to keep a lid on prices.\"If these weather forecasts do play out then I would think the farm sector output will certainly get affected,\" Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS Bank Ltd, said in an interview to Bloomberg TV Wednesday.Above-normal temperatures along with heat wave conditions are expected in most parts of India during three months ending May 31, threatening to lower crop production and hurting the efforts to control food costs. That's also bad news for about two-thirds of India's population dependent on agriculture, which contributes about 14% to the gross domestic product.With a 3.7% growth, India's farm sector powered the economy in the last quarter when manufacturing output faltered and services growth softened. As the chances of a crop-damaging heat wave rise, this growth driver may take a hit. The government's forecast for a record wheat and rice production this year is also at risk as deficient rains could keep domestic food costs elevated, complicating the job of the Reserve Bank of India that is seen hiking rates in April amid slowing demand.Fiscal Situation\"A drought this year is likely to lead to worse price fluctuations, given the already tight supply situation and entrenched price pressures,\" said Madhavi Arora, an economist with Emkay Global Financial Services. This will tighten the fiscal situation further as the government would need to provide higher price guarantee to farmers, she said.This also implies a potential impact on fertilizer prices, with usage likely to increase during a poor monsoon year to maintain crop yields, according to Arora, who sees fertilizer subsidies staying at an elevated level after a record payout in the current year, further reducing the government's fiscal wiggle room.The finance ministry has already acknowledged risks to growth and prices if El Nino conditions return. Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran on Tuesday flagged the need to be ready with both supply side and monetary policy measures in the wake of a deficient monsoon season.The central bank, which has raised borrowing costs by 250 basis points since May to bring inflation within its 2%-6% target band, is also aware that the risks from adverse weather events remain.The meteorological department's predictions are \"drawing a worrisome backdrop for harvest of the winter crop as well as sowing in the summer period,\" said Rao. \"Unfortunately irrigation covers only 50% of the crop land and there's significant reliance on these rains.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The Centre's friction with judiciary on the judges' appointment issue has worsened lately.New Delhi:The Supreme Court Collegium's recommendation for the elevation of a lawyer to the Karnataka High Court was refused thrice by the government because of his \"deep affiliation\" to a political party, sources have told NDTV. The Collegium's communication in this matter also says the government deliberately delayed the file, pointing out that it is against the law, the sources added.The Collegium had recommended Nagendra Ramachandra Naik's name four times -- a rare occurrence in the appointment of a high court judge. The first time was on October 3, 2019. Subsequently, the Collegium recommended his name twice in 2021 and once in January this year, sources said.In its third reiteration, the Collegium said the government deliberately delayed clearing Mr Naik's file. Such delay \"affects the individual lawyer professionally as well as the institution\", the communication said, according to sources.The government's action is in violation of the law as laid down in the Second Judges case, the Collegium has told the government, sources said.They also added that the Collegium had recommended the lawyer's name after taking into consideration the allegations on his political affiliations and criminal record. The communication pointed out that as a matter of convention, the government has to accept a name that is sent by the Supreme Court Collegium for a second time.The Collegium said inputs regarding criminal complaints against him appear to be baseless and were considered earlier. So it had reiterated its earlier recommendation for his elevation on January 16, 2023 for the third time, sources said.Over the last few years, the government had withheld approval on names of judges repeatedly, as its disagreement with the top court on the judges' appointment issue worsened.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comLast month, the Collegium made public the reasons for the government's objections to the elevation of three senior advocates and its own response in the matter, uploading its letters to the government on its website. The move to publicise a confidential document had upset the government, which reiterated its view seeking a larger role in the appointment of judges.The very public disagreement between the judiciary and the government has exacerbated a shortage of high court judges and a backlog of cases. It amounts to the undermining the strength and independence of the judiciary, many former judges have said.",

        "text": "India is committed to eradicating terrorism entirely, Ruchira Kamboj (File)India has voiced concern over the spread of terrorism particularly in regions of Africa and Asia, and asserted that those States which provide shelter to terrorists should be called out and held accountable for their deeds, in a veiled reference to Pakistan.\"The threat of terrorism is serious and real. Regrettably, despite best efforts aimed towards transnational cooperation, it continues to spread, particularly in the regions of Africa and Asia,\" India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ruchira Kamboj said.In her remarks to the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism Ambassadorial-level Quarterly Briefing to Member States on Tuesday, Kamboj said the threat of terrorism can only be tackled through consistent and unified multilateral action, by the international community.\"Those States which lack capacities to tackle the threat of terrorism, should be assisted, while those which provide shelter to terrorists should be called out and held accountable for their deeds,\" she said, making a thinly-veiled reference to Pakistan.Noting the spread of terrorism as a \"worrying\" trend that needs urgent reversal, Kamboj underlined the need to keep divisive narratives at bay.\"We should accordingly refrain from the classification of terrorism. The usage of terms such as 'right wing' or 'left wing' or 'far right' or 'far left' are fraught with the misuse of them by vested interests,\" she said.She stressed that it is important that the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy should continue to enjoy the support of all member states. Noting that the current Review Resolution adopted in 2021 is relevant and balanced, she said the upcoming Review should be a technical update of this Resolution, taking into account the activities and achievements of the United Nations and other important fora.Further, she underscored the importance of protecting the secular nature of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\"India strongly condemns all kinds of terrorist attacks irrespective of religion, belief, culture, race or ethnicity. In the same vein, we also condemn terrorist attacks motivated by Islamophobia, Christianophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-Sikh, anti-Buddhist, anti-Hindu prejudices,\" she said.The 7th Review took into account the first three kinds of attacks while failing to address the rest, Ruchira Kamboj said, adding that a more sagacious approach would be to keep this reference broad, abandoning thereby a list-based approach in the upcoming Review.India also highlighted the need for the international community to exert energy on addressing more serious issues such as the growing threat of terror financing, which has been further exacerbated by the use of new and emerging technologies by Terrorists and Terrorist Groups.India had hosted the 3rd 'No Money for Terror' Conference in November 2022 and had offered to host the Permanent Secretariat for the Conference in Delhi, as one of the concrete outcomes of that event.In October 2022, India, as Chair, had hosted the Special meeting of the Counter Terrorism Committee, which had adopted the Delhi Declaration on countering the use of new and emerging technologies, highlighting not only the threat, but paving the way for a futuristic road-map for the CTC to help member states address this threat holistically.Ruchira Kamboj said India has never hesitated from \"walking the talk\" in the effort to fight back the terrorist scourge.In recent years, India has contributed more than USD 2 million to the UN Office of Counter Terrorism in support of its global programmes to counter financing of terrorism as well as stemming terrorists' travels. \"Going forward, we also reiterate our support to provide more financial resources to UNOCT from the regular UN budget,\" she said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comCiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has said \"even a single act of terrorism is one too many, even a single life lost is one too many\", Kamboj said with this conviction, India is committed to eradicating terrorism entirely and will not rest until this goal is achieved.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

a lawyer working on an Ipad within the precincts of a courtroom should be allowed to work on it so long as they are not watching movies from the Ipad or their laptops,\" the CJI said.\"We must set up internet facilities within our courtrooms and of course have adequately maintained firewalls so that the facility is put to genuine and authorised use,\" he said.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has commenced a new initiative for translating its judgements in every language recognised by the Indian constitution and that 3,000 such judgments have already been translated in different Indian languages.\"I would earnestly appeal to the Calcutta High Court as well to ... ensure that your judgements are available in simple language to the people as we understand the language,\" he said.The CJI said that this will truly ensure that the judiciary reaches out to citizens.Chief Justice Chandrachud said that rather than choosing a strategy where technology is designed to respond to problems which have already arisen, a strategy must be embraced where the existing systems are periodically revamped by using technology.\"If we do this, we will be able to meet any challenge head-on regardless of whether the challenges are foreseen,\" he said.The CJI said that the e-committee of the Supreme Court, which he heads, had been expanding the technological capacities of the courts long before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020.\"It was because of this that we were able to conduct virtual hearings during the pandemic,\" he said.Holding that public institutions must not lag behind private entities or individuals when it comes to the adoption of technology, he said that they must instead lead the way.The CJI lauded the Calcutta High Court for \"doing exactly this\" by initiating several e-services meant for litigants, lawyers, registry and the bench.\"Today we have launched the Calcutta High Court mobile application, a justice clock for the high court, a personal information system software, e-filing and we inaugurate e-seva kendras,\" he said, following which he inaugurated the services through the virtual mode from the Supreme Court.The CJI said that the Calcutta High Court mobile applications will be available in both android and IOS operating systems.He said that the litigants too will find the applications very useful because the citizenry is able to afford mobile phones more easily than they can afford desktops or laptops.\"If a litigant wants to check the status of their case they will find it far easier to use the mobile app than the web browser,\" he said, adding that technology makes the justice system more accessible to all the strata of society.Holding that the judiciary cannot afford to leave any segment of citizens behind, he said that among the advantages of e-seva kendras, the foremost virtue is that they ensure that every lawyer and litigant is able to reap the fruits of the collective technological progress.He expressed hope that e-filing will be implemented in every district of West Bengal, while lauding the implementation of the service at the City Civil Court, Calcutta, and at the commercial court complexes at Alipore, Asansol and Rajarhat and inauguration of e-seva kendras at Bankura, Purulia, South 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur districts.Stating that over Rs 7,000 crore have been allocated for the phase III of the e-courts budget, he said, \"funds will not be a constraining factor for us anymore, the constraints will be our own ability to design, manage and implement a project of this magnitude.\" He said that with the anticipated release of the first tranche of funds for phase III, planning must begin now on how to utilise the funds for the judiciary in West Bengal and ensure that these funds are put to use immediately and for good purpose.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comChief Justice of Calcutta High Court Justice Prakash Shrivastava, Justice T S Sivagnanam, Justice I P Mukerji and other judges of the high court were present at the function which was held at the sesquicentenary building of the high court.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

In Meghalaya, the BJP's estranged ally Conrad Sangma's NPP is leading but hasn't cross the majority mark yet.Here are the top 10 developments:In Tripura, the ruling BJP has taken a lead over its nearest rival, the Left-Congress alliance. The BJP is hoping for a big comeback, far above its 2018 score of 36. The BJP is currently leading on 33 seats, three above the halfway-mark.\"Tripura will have a BJP Chief Minister, Nagaland will have a coalition government while that of Meghalaya will be decided as per seats won by the BJP,\" Himanta Biswa Sarma, Assam Chief Minister and the BJP's chief strategist in the northeast, predicted yesterday.The Tipra Motha, led by former royalPradyot Manikya Debbarma, is leading on 12 seats in Tripura. The tribal-dominated party, which is pushing for a Greater Tipraland, is being seen as an x-factor in these elections.Meghalayaappears to be headed towards a hung assembly, with no party in clear majority yet. Conrad Sangma's National People's Party or NPP is leading on 26 seats, five short of the majority mark.InNagaland, the BJP and its partner NDPP (Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party) have surged ahead and are leading on 39 seats in the 60-member assembly.Theoutcome of these elections, along with other polls later this year, will be crucial for parties ahead of next year's general election.In Meghalaya, the BJP and Conrad Sangma's NPP contested the election separately after a five-year alliance. But the parties are believed to be in talks. Mr Sangma and Himanta Biswa Sarma held discussions in a midnight meeting in Guwahati on Tuesday. Sources said they discussed the possibility of a post-poll alliance, though the leaders played it down as a \"meeting between friends\".In Nagaland, The NDPP, led by Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, has been in an alliance with the BJP since the last elections in 2018. The alliance had won 30 seats in the previous elections while NPF won 26.The CPM, which ruled Tripura for 35 years, has joined forces with the Congress in what is largely being seen as a last-ditch effort to regain its numbers. Over the last five years, both parties have suffered a massive erosion of their support base. The CPM contested 47 of the state's 60 seats, leaving just 13 for the Congress.Results will also be declared for a series of by-polls the Erode (East) seat in Tamil Nadu, Sagardighi in West Bengal, Ramgarh in Jharkhand and Kasba Peth and Chinchwad in Maharashtra.Post a comment",

        "text": "India's assertion came at the inaugural session of the G20 anti-corruption working group meet. (File)Gurugram:India on Wednesday emphasised on multilateral action rather than bilateral coordination to ensure the faster extradition of fugitive economic offenders and recovery of stolen assets from abroad during the anti-corruption working group meeting of G20 nations in Gurugram.The assertion assumes significance as the country has been putting in efforts to extradite fugitive economic offenders, including diamond merchant Nirav Modi and businessman Vijay Mallya, from different countries.In the inaugural session of the important anti-graft meet, Union Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said the corrupt find a way to park their proceeds of crime and \"it is such money that is pushed into evil activities\".\"This is one of the major sources of terror funding. From illegal drugs that destroy young lives to human trafficking, from weakening democracies to sale of illegal arms, this dirty money funds many destructive enterprises,\" he said.Mr Singh said there is a need for the global community to work even faster for the recovery of assets through proactive sharing of information between the G20 countries.\"Therefore, for better coordination, streamlining of judicial processes and timely disposal of cases, there is a requirement for multilateral action rather than bilateral coordination, which proves to be more complex and presents obstacles in making progress on cases related to fugitive economic offenders and recovery of related assets,\" the minister said.According to the Directorate of Enforcement, since 2014, the fugitive economic offenders, viz. Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Nitin Jayantilal Sandesara, Chetan Kumar Jayantilal Sandesara, Dipti Chetan Sandesara and Hitesh Kumar Narendrabhai Patel are wanted in financial crimes involving thousands of crores of rupees.Nirav Modi is wanted in India to stand trial on fraud and money laundering charges in over Rs 6,400 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan scam case and Mallya is facing charges in Rs 9,000 crore loan default case involving his disbanded Kingfisher Airlines.The Union minister said there have been numerous instances of financial or banking frauds that were investigated under relevant statutory provisions that involved high net worth individuals where the proceeds of crime involved was more than $1 billion.During the course of investigation, it was found that the offenders fled the country before or after detection of offence and as a result, their passports were revoked with a view to restrict their movement, the minister said.\"The Enforcement Directorate has transferred assets worth about $180 billion to public sector banks that suffered losses to the tune of around $272 billion due to frauds committed allegedly by high-net-worth individuals,\" Mr Singh said.Even after initiating the process of getting information from foreign countries on assets through Letters Rogatory (LR), the process of extradition was found to be highly complex and time-consuming that led to delay in investigation and trial of offences, he said.\"It is our considered view that strengthening of mechanisms for speedy confiscation of the proceeds of crime, both at home and abroad, will force the offenders to return to their home country,\" the minister said.This will allow for an effective investigation and speedy trial for the related offence, he added.\"This would also help the banks and other financial institutions and tax authorities to achieve recovery from defaults committed by such FEOs, thus restoring, to some extent the overall health of these banks and other financial institutions, while eliminating the possibility of further misuse of these funds,\" Mr Singh said.He said corruption is a complex social, political, and economic challenge affecting all countries and in a globalised world, corruption has ramifications well beyond the G20.Mr Singh said it adversely impacts the effective utilization of resources, creates market distortions, adversely impacts the quality of life of citizens, impacting the benefits of globalisation and consequently, economic growth and overall governance and most disproportionately affecting the poor and most marginalised.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has envisioned developing such an administrative ecosystem for a developed India, which has zero tolerance for corruption.\"Taking inspiration from him, India's presidency will aim to focus on pragmatic action-oriented steps in addressing the wider implications of corruption to strengthen international cooperation on anti-corruption matters and deepen the G20 commitment towards countering the corrupt actors and corruption,\" the minister said.As the primary forum for global economic cooperation, the G20 has to take responsibility to lead global efforts towards battling the menace of corruption, he said.Since its inception in 2010, the G20 anti-corruption working group (ACWG) has been at the forefront of addressing all forms of corruption, Mr Singh said. \"The Indian G20 Presidency will build on the robust foundation laid in the G20 ACWG during the previous presidencies and further strengthen the G20 nations' commitment to ensuring zero tolerance against corruption,\" the minister said.He said the Prime Minister has stated at numerous occasions that \"a safe and secure world is our shared responsibility\" and that \"when the forces of good cooperate, the forces of crime cannot operate\".The minister emphasised that India's G20 Presidency will focus on providing an effective, efficient, and responsive mechanism on asset recovery and information sharing between the G20 countries.\"It is important that all the state parties reflect the same determination against corruption,\" Mr Singh said and added that the working group under the co-chairship of Italy \"will come up with substantial outcomes aimed at preventing and combatting corruption\".The minister said that India has taken initiatives such as the 'Direct Benefit Transfer' (DBT) which has won the country global accolades.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"The IMF described DBT as a 'logistical marvel' that ensures efficiency and transparency, and eliminates intermediaries in the delivery of funds to the targeted beneficiaries.

The BJP-led alliance's tally had dropped below the halfway mark after a brisk start, but picked up in the later rounds. While the BJP finished with 32 seats, its ally IPFT scored one.The Left-Congress alliance won 14 seats, a disappointing performance considering both parties had claimed they would register victory.The big story of this election is Tipra Motha, led by former royal Pradyot Manikya Debbarma. The party, which was being seen as an x-factor in these polls, won 13 seats.While the BJP-led alliance's tally has dropped by more than 10 seats, the party's seat count has marginally dropped from 36 to 33. It is ally IPFT (Indigenous People's Front of Tripura) that has been routed in this election, winning just one seat as compared to eight in 2018. The IPFT's dismal show points to a shift of tribal votes to Tipra Motha.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe BJP had earlier reached out to Tipra Motha, but the talks fell through over the tribal-dominated party's statehood demand.The desperate move by the CPM and the Congress to join forces has not paid off. Both parties, which have suffered a massive erosion of support over the past few years, have put up a disappointing show. Its current tally of 14 is lower than the 16 seats won by the CPM in 2018, when it contested alone. The Congress, however, will find some consolation in the fact that it has won 2 seats and is leading in one, after failing to bag any Assembly seat in 2018.",

It can be a case of pure love for each other,\" the court said.\"It appears that now the colour has been tried to be given of love jihad, but when love is accepted then there is less possibility of the person being trapped just for converting him into the other's religion,\" it added.As per the prosecution case, the man and the woman were in a relationship since March 2018. The man belonged to a Scheduled Caste community but did not disclose this to the woman.Later, the woman began insisting he should convert to Islam and marry her, after which the man disclosed his caste identity to her parents. They did not object to his caste identity and convinced their daughter to accept it.But the relations later turned sour, following which the man lodged a case against the woman and her family in December 2022.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe HC, while granting pre-arrest bail to the woman and her family, said the probe into the case was almost over and hence their custody would not be necessary.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "On Election Commission Appointments, Supreme Court's Massive Order",
        "text": "Election Commissioners will be appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, the Leader of Opposition and the Chief Justice of India, the Supreme Court ruled today in a landmark order aimed at insulating the top election body from political interference.But in what many believe gives the government an out, the court said the order will hold good \"until a law is made by parliament\".The Chief Election Commissioner and the two election commissioners, who oversee polls across the country, will be appointed by the President on the advice of a panel that gives the opposition and the judiciary a say in the process. If there is no Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the single largest opposition party will be on the panel, the Supreme Court said.\"Elections should undoubtedly be fair and the buck stops with the Election Commission of India to ensure its purity is maintained,\" said a five-judge Constitution bench led by Justice KM Joseph.\"In democracy, the purity of elections must be maintained or else it would lead to disastrous consequences,\" said the unanimous verdict that comes before a string of state polls and the 2024 national election. Democracy is fragile and will collapse if lip service is paid to rule of law, the judges said.\"As long as the party that is voted into power is concerned, there is, not unnaturally, a near insatiable quest to continue in the saddle. A pliable Election Commission, an unfair and biased overseer of the foundational exercise of adult franchise, which lies at the heart of democracy, who obliges the powers that be, perhaps offers the surest gateway to acquisition and retention of power,\" said the Supreme Court.While delivering the far-reaching verdict, the Supreme Court called for the Election Commission to have an independent secretariat, rule-making powers, an independent budget, and protection from impeachment. The court said the Election Commission should draw funds directly from the Consolidated Fund of India, instead of having to go to the Prime Minister's Officer and the Law Ministry for funds and approvals.\"The Election Commission must act within the constitutional framework and law and cannot act in an unfair manner,\" the court said, adding that an Election Commission that didn't have a free and fair role in the process \"guarantees breakdown of rule of law, which is the bedrock of the democracy\".\"There cannot be any doubt that the Election Commission of India is to perform the arduous and unenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugation by and interference from the executive.\"The Supreme Court had in earlier hearings stressed on a \"fair and transparent mechanism\" so that the \"best man\" is appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner of the country.In the current system, the President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and two commissioners for six years on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, and they are usually former bureaucrats.Petitions had sought a collegium-like system for appointing election commissioners, arguing that the existing process was driven by \"whims and fancies of the executive\".The petitions said unlike the appointments of the CBI director or corruption watchdog Lokpal, where the leader of the Opposition and judiciary have a say, the Centre unilaterally appointed members of the Election Commission.The Supreme Court had questioned the Centre on the \"tearing hurry\" with which it appointed former IAS officer Arun Goel as an Election Commissioner at \"lightning speed\", within 24 hours. The judges had asked to see the files, saying they wanted to know if there was any \"hanky-panky\".Arun Goel, a 1985-batch IAS officer, took voluntary retirement on November 18 and was appointed Election Commissioner a day later. He took charge on November 21. He is in line to be the next Chief Election Commissioner in 2025, when the current chief's term ends.The Supreme Court, on examining the file, asked how the Ministry of Law and Justice shortlisted four names for Election Commissioner. None of them would get even six years as Election Commissioner, it said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe opposition Congress called for the resignation of all three Election Commissioners. \"They can be appointed and eligible if the selection committee decides. There will be an attempt by the government to amend the Supreme Court decision, try to weaken the order,\" said Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, calling the Supreme Court order \"historic\".Other opposition parties also welcomed the ruling. \"Huge. So Extremely Compromised (EC) can again strive to become Extremely Competent,\" Trinamool Congress leader Derek O'Brien posted.",

The number of members of the UN has quadrupled in this period. It neither reflects today's politics, economics, demographics or aspirations. Since 2005, we have heard sentiments for reform being expressed at the highest level. But as we all know these have not materialised. The reasons are no secret either. The longer we put it off, the more the credibility of multilateralism stands eroded. Global decision-making must be democratised if it has to have a future,\" said Mr Jaishankar in an opening remark.The G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting commenced with a minute's silence observed for those who lost their lives in the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.\"Before I commence proceedings, let us observe a minute of silence in memory of the many who lost their lives in the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria. Our deepest condolences to the bereaved families,\" said Mr Jaishankar.The minister began the first session of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting by reminding the foreign delegates that \"this grouping bears an exceptional responsibility.\"\"We first came together in the midst of a global crisis and are today, once again, actually confronting multiple ones. These include the impact of the Covid pandemic, concerns of fragile supply chains, the knock-on effects of ongoing conflicts, anxiety of debt crises and the disruption of climate events. In considering these issues, we may not all always be of one mind. In fact, there are some matters of sharp differences of opinions and views. Yet, we must find common ground and provide direction, because that is what the world expects of us,\" said Mr Jaishankar.Speaking on the future of multilateralism, he said, \"As we look ahead, there are both pressing and more systemic challenges that we all confront. The future of multilateralism depends very much on our ability to strengthen it in a changing world.\"He focussed on developing cooperation to mitigate the food crisis magnified by recent events.\"Food and energy security are immediate anxieties, magnified by recent events. But they do have long-term repercussions and solutions. And development cooperation is part of that larger solution that we are deliberating upon today,\" said Mr Jaishankar.He also discussed the agendas for today's discussions that included challenges of food, fertilizers and fuel security that are make-or-break issues for developing countries.\"We heard their concerns directly in January this year through the Voice of Global South Summit. Such issues should not be relegated to the periphery of the international discourse. They are in fact, crucial to the global economy and must be treated as such. Indeed, we urge that they be central to any decision-making. Along with that, the world must also strive for more reliable and resilient supply chains. Recent experience has underlined the risks of being dependent on limited geographies,\" said the minister.He said that G20 group have individually and collectively an obligation to contribute to international growth and prosperity, adding that these can be implemented through sustainable partnerships and goodwill initiatives.\"On its part, India has undertaken development projects in 78 countries and has actively encouraged exchanges and capability building. During the Covid pandemic, we made a conscious effort at contributing to global solutions even while looking after our own. Today's situation demands that we continue to live up to our international responsibilities. The G20 must be sensitive to all our partners' priorities and economic concerns, especially those more vulnerable. We must ensure demand-driven and sustainable development cooperation based on country ownership and transparency. Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity are essential guiding principles for such cooperation,\" added Mr Jaishankar.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comHe reaffirmed that G20 Foreign Ministers can send a collective message of its determination to address the complex challenges that the world face at this juncture, adding, \"I look forward to our deliberations in this regard.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The CPI(M) had won two seats.This time, Tipra Motha has replaced the IPFT as the most prominent tribal party as it has apparently won over the support of a large section of tribal voters with Debbarma's promise of a 'Greater Tipraland'.The BJP's alliance with the IPFT was credited as the major factor behind toppling the Left Front government in the 2018 elections.With the IPFT failing to deliver on its promise of 'Tipraland', a populist demand raised ahead of the 2018 elections, Debbarma started penetrating tribal belts systematically, encashing his royal legacy.Gradually, he managed to portray himself as the savour of the indigenous people, who started calling him 'bubagra (king)', and reducing the IPFT into a spent force in the tribal-dominated areas.Mr Debbarma's plan worked a charm as his newly floated party reduced the IPFT to zero in the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections just three months after its formation in April 2022.The CPI(M), which once had a stronghold in the hills, has also ceded control to Tipra Motha.In the TTAADC elections, Tipra Motha won 18 seats while the BJP could only manage 10.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comDespite several attempts at outreach, neither the ruling BJP nor the opposition CPI(M) could ally with the Tipra Motha for the assembly polls.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Leave this court right now. You cannot cower us down!\"Vikas Singh, the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, was pushing for a hearing on a petition by the lawyers' body seeking that land allotted to the Supreme Court be used for a chamber block for lawyers. Lawyers had been struggling to have the case listed for the past six months, he said.\"You can't demand land like this. You tell us the day we are sitting idle for the whole day?\" Justice Chandrachud remarked.Mr Singh threatened to doorstep the Chief Justice. \" I am not saying that you are sitting idle for the whole day. I am only trying to get the matter listed. If it is not done, I will have to escalate and take it to your lordships' residence. I don't want the Bar to be taken like this,\" he said.\"Don't threaten the Chief Justice. Is this a way to behave?\" Justice Chandrachud shot back.\"I am the Chief Justice.

I will not do that in the final two years of my career.\"The Chief Justice continued, \"You will be treated as an ordinary litigant. Please don't force my hand to do something you don't want.\"During the sharp back-and-forth, Justice Chandrachud even asked the lawyer to not raise his voice.Mr Singh said he \"felt strongly\" about the subject as lawyers had been waiting for chambers for 20 years. \"Just because the bar doesn't do anything doesn't mean it should be taken for granted,\" he said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Please don't raise your voice. This is not the way to behave as the President of SCBA. You're asking for land allotted to the Supreme Court to be given to the bar. I have made my decision.

Heavyweight leader Sudip Roy Barman too has seen his share of ups and downs, changing three parties and fine-tuning his political positions.What has not changed is Agartala's rock-solid support for the 56-year-old Barman, who is set to represent the seat in Assembly for 30 years with his sixth thumping victory.The son of former chief minister Samir Ranjan Barman, Mr Barman started his political career with the Congress' student wing NSUI. He later rose up the party ranks to become the party's state chief.Mr Barman lost his first Assembly poll contest in 1993 when he was against former Chief Minister Nripen Chakraborty. He went on to win the seat in 1998 and has not looked back since.In 2016, Mr Barman was among six Congress MLAs who switched to Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, protesting the Congress's Bengal alliance with the CPM.A year later, he switched again, this time to the BJP. He was also named minister in the Biplab Deb cabinet after the BJP's 2018 victory, but was removed soon after for alleged anti-party activities.Last year, Mr Barman came a full circle, returning to the Congress and interestingly, fighting an election in which the Left and the Congress have tied up.While Mr Barman cruised to victory with a comfortable margin of 8,162 votes, his claims for a BJP rout fell flat.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comSpeaking to NDTV in the run-up to the election, he had said that the BJP would be \"uprooted\" in this contest. \"BJP is all set to be uprooted. The election is the mandate of the people. The people are very much disgruntled and annoyed with the BJP because of their misrule and corruption, fake promises delivered in 2018. I left the BJP because they never heard the voice of the people,\" he had said.The Left-Congress alliance won just 14 seats as the BJP returned to power with a tally of 32.",

Meghalaya appears set for a hung assembly, with Conrad Sangma's party leading the field.Here are the Top 10 points in this big story:The BJP and its ally IPFT (Indigenous Progressive Front of Tripura) are leading on 34 of Tripura's 60 seats. But the score is down by 10 from 2018, when the BJP alone won 36 seats. The IPFT had won 8.This time the BJP is leading on 28 seats, way below the \"tsunami\" Chief Minister Manik Saha had predicted. Asked about the matter, Mr Saha said the party will have to introspect\" about why the results did not match expectations.The Left, which ruled the state for 35 years, and its new ally Congress, are leading on 14 seats, down by two.Erstwhile royal Pradyot Kishore Debbarma's Tipra Motha, which made its debut in this election, is leading on 12 seats. The tribal-dominated party that is pushing for a Greater Tipraland, appears to have grabbed the IPFT's tribal support.In Meghalaya, Conrad Sangma's National People's Party, which led the ruling alliance with the BJP, contested solo this time and is ahead on 26 of the state's 60 seats. It needs at least five more to reach the majority mark. The BJP is leading on five seats and may be the answer to NPP's numbers shortage.Mr Sangma is apparently in talks for a post-poll alliance -- a meeting with the BJP's northeast pointsperson Himanta Biswa Sarma took place yesterday. The two leaders though, had played down the meet, saying it was a meeting between friends.The two parties had fallen apart ahead of the election over corruption allegations against Mr Sangma's party.\"We will wait for the final results and then decide how to go forward, Mr Sangma told reporters.In Meghalaya, new entrant Trinamool Congress is leading on five seats, and defying exit poll predictions, the Congress is leading on five seats.In Nagaland, the BJP and its partner NDPP (Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party) are leading on 38 seats -- eight more than the last time.

Tripura and Nagaland under its belt with the help of allies, the party is making efforts to form government in Meghalaya with Conrad Sangma.Here's your 10-point cheatsheet to this big storyMeghalaya was heading for a hung house when Conrad Sangma dialled the BJP's chief strategist Amit Shah for a renewal of their alliance. The state's ruling allies had decided to contest solo ahead of the election, following a rift over corruption allegations against the NPP.Mr Sangma's National People's Party was the single largest party with 26 seats while the BJP won two in the 60-member assembly. The United Democratic Party, which was NPP's ally, emerged as the second-largest party, winning 11 seats up from six in 2018. New entrant Trinamool Congress and the Congress won five seats each.In Tripura, the BJP won 32 seats and its ally, the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura or IPFT, one, cruising past the half-way mark of 30 to retain power. The victory, though, was well short of the \"tsunami\" predicted by Chief Minister Manik Saha and below the BJP's 2018 score of 36.The big headline was erstwhile royal Pradyot Manikya Debburma's Tipra Motha, which won 13 seats on its debut election and emerged as the second largest party in the state. The rise of tribal-backed Tipra Motha appeared to be at the cost of the BJP local partner IPFT, whose numbers slid from eight to one.In Nagaland, the BJP retained 12 seats, its ally Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party or NDPP won 25 to gain a second term with a huge mandate. The alliance had won 30 seats in the last election. The state also had its first women MLAs since Independence, with the victory of both women candidates of the NDPP.In his congratulatory message to the three states, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the results show the people's \"strong faith in democracy and democratic institutions in the country\". \"The way the northeast poll results have been extensively highlighted shows the region is neither distant from Dilli nor dil (heart),\" the Prime Minister added.This second mandate for the BJP in Tripura was a crushing defeat for the CPM, which ruled the state for 35 years. Ahead of the election, the party had tied up with Congress in what was seen as a last-ditch attempt to shore up its numbers.But the Congress could only add three seats to their tally of 14. In Meghalaya, the Congress won just five of the 60 seats it contested and failed to open its account in Nagaland, where it fielded candidates in 23 of 60 seats.New Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge brushed off the party's electoral performance in the northeast, saying they were \"small states\" that go with \"Central government trend\".It invited a swift rebuttal from PM Modi, who said the comment \"is an insult to the mandate and the people of the northeast states\". \"Today's results have exposed Congress's thinking about the northeast,\" he said.Post a comment",

The number has now increased to 231 after the state cabinet recently approved inclusion of 22 more castes in the state OBC list.The state government's earlier attempt to earmark 27 per cent quota for OBCs was challenged in the Odisha Administrative Tribunal as it exceeded the reservation ceiling of 50 per cent in respect of ST, SC and SEBC in public employment, as laid down by Supreme Court.It had to be brought down to 11.25%.The member secretary of the National Commission for Backward Classes, V V Yadav said state government has accepted the OSCBC's proposal to resume the survey of the social and educational conditions of people in the category.The entire process of the survey in all 314 blocks and areas under 114 civic bodies in the state will be completed by July 12, 2023, he said in a letter to the collectors and commissioners of municipal corporations, he said in a letter.The survey will be undertaken under the supervision of OSCBC and district collectors and municipal chiefs should prepare and send their survey management plans to the Commission by the first week of March.The plans will contain district profiles, information on survey centers, enumerators, supervisors and other survey-related officers, along with their deployment.The opposition BJP has criticised the state government for not taking measures to ensure reservations for OBCs in education and employment.BJP MLA Suryavanshi Suraj termed the government's move as \"vote bank politics\".\"The survey has been ordered to get OBC votes in the coming general and state polls.

Before joining politics, Saha used to teach at Tripura Medical College located in Hapania.He had only 10 months as the Chief Minister of the northeastern state after replacing Deb but managed to lift the state government's image before the February 16 assembly polls.The gentleman politician did his schooling in Tripura in the early 1970's and then went on to do his higher education in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.In January, Mr Saha shared on Twitter how he conducted surgery on a 10-year-old boy after a long time at Tripura Medical College. Netizens praised him for still performing his duties as a doctor and said it was truly inspiring . The selection of Mr Saha as Chief Minister by the BJP, had sparked a controversy within the Tripura unit of the BJP with several ministers, MLAs and senior leaders expressing discontent, which never really died down in party circles.In an interview to PTI in February, Mr Saha said he has been able to gain the people's faith in just a few months. \"Wherever I go, I see people are happy as they have received several benefits from PMAY to piped water to toilets under several flagship programmes. (However) I do believe there is a need to do more in the employment generation segment.\"The overall law and order has improved in the state over the past five years with all types of crime - murder, rape and abduction - coming down drastically. The NCRB reports endorses our view on the law-and-order situation\", he had claimed, rubbishing the opposition's allegations of widespread violence in rural areas as baseless .Asked if he would continue as Chief Minister after the elections, Mr Saha had made it clear, \"It is the party and Modiji who will make the choice. If they think I am the man for the work, I will be picked.... I always prefer to play on a straight bat\".PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOn unfinished commitments, Mr Saha said he will take up the issue of the High Power Modality Committee constituted to look into the socio-economic-linguistic development of the state's indigenous people as part of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) contracted by the BJP and IPFT before the 2018 Assembly election with Delhi. The Union Home Ministry has constituted a high-power modality committee but the recommendations of the panel have not been made public yet.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The decision comes after an investigation into allegations of share price manipulation by certain entities of two companies, Sharpline Broadcast Ltd and Sadhna Broadcast Ltd, through uploading misleading videos on YouTube channels.SEBI found that certain individuals uploaded false and misleading videos recommending investors buy shares of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd and Sharpline Broadcast Ltd for extraordinary profits. In addition to Arshad Warsi and Maria Goretti, some promoters of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd have also been restrained from participating in the securities market.Along with the ban, SEBI has impounded illegal gains worth Rs 54 crore made by the entities after misleading videos were uploaded on YouTube channels. Two separate interim orders detail the investigation's findings.According to the interim order, Arshad Warsi made a profit of Rs 29.43 lakh, Maria Goretti earned a profit of Rs 37.56 lakh, and Iqbal Hussain Warsi made a gain of Rs 9.34 lakh. These three individuals, among others, have been classified as volume creators by SEBI.The investigation began after SEBI received complaints alleging that certain entities were engaging in price manipulation and offloading shares of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd and Sharpline Broadcast Ltd. The complaints alleged that misleading videos with false content about the two companies were uploaded to lure investors.SEBI conducted an examination from April-September 2022 and found that there was a significant increase in the price and volume of shares of the two companies between April and mid-July 2022. False and misleading videos about Sadhna Broadcast Ltd were uploaded on two YouTube channels, The Advisor and Moneywise, during the second half of July 2022. Similarly, similar videos about Sharpline Broadcast Ltd were uploaded on two YouTube channels, Midcap calls and Profit Yatra, in the second half of May 2022.SEBI classified the entities into categories such as creators of YouTube channels, net sellers/promoters and profit makers, volume creators, and information carriers. According to SEBI, these entities collectively helped create trading volumes and interest in the shares, spread false and misleading YouTube videos, and induced investors to buy the shares at inflated prices, thereby violating the provisions of PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) rules. Collectively, net sellers/promoters and some of the volume creators made extraordinary profits as a result of this scheme.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIn the case of Sadhna Broadcast Ltd, SEBI found that the elaborate modus operandi adopted by the entities, including the egregious misuse of patently false and misleading YouTube videos, had led to a drastic increase in the number of small shareholders, from 2,167 to 55,343, who ended up buying shares at an inflated price. The number of small shareholders increased from 517 to 20,009 in the case of Sharpline Broadcast Ltd.SEBI has barred the 45 entities \"from buying, selling, or dealing in securities either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever until further orders.\" Additionally, the entities have been directed not to dispose of any assets, including money in bank accounts, without prior permission from SEBI until the impounded amount is deposited in the escrow account.",

Two more BJP leaders came from Delhi ... we declined as they said we cannot agree (to a separate Tipraland),\" he said, though he held out the possibility of extending outside support under certain circumstances and subject to caveats.Sarma, whose stock is high in Delhi had earlier captured eyeballs as the BJP's first star campaigner from the region in far away Gujarat and Delhi.Be it the imposition of Uniform Civil Code (UCC), PFI ban, passing of the Cattle Protection Act, calling for specific policy measures for slowing down minority population growth or bulldozing of \"illegal\" villages, Sarma has left no stone unturned to push forward assertively the right-wing party's key agenda in his home state and in states where he has campaigned.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comHowever, interestingly, these pet projects of his, which could have made him unpopular in Christian-dominated states like Nagaland and Meghalaya seems to have become non-factors in his political wheeling-dealings in these very states.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

There were divergences. There were differences, which we could not be reconciled,\" Mr Jaishankar said, explaining why there was an outcome document instead of a joint statement.Sources say both Russia and China raised objections to the wording on the Ukraine war, thwarting a joint statement for the second time.Last week, a meeting of G20 Finance Ministers in Bengaluru failed to agree on a common statement after Russia and China similarly sought to water down language on the Ukraine war. A \"Chair's Summary\" was published at the end of the discussions.The Foreign Minister stressed that there was agreement on \"the bulk of issues\" involving the concerns of the global south.\"There were a large number of issues on which there was agreement, like strengthening multilateralism, promoting food and energy security, climate change, gender issues, counter terror...On the bulk of issues which concern the global south, there was a considerable meeting of minds that has been captured by outcome document,\" he said.\"If we had a perfect meeting of minds on all issues, it would have been a collective statement. In terms of the outcome document you will see that there was almost 90 per cent agreement. Just, on two paras we were not able to get everybody on the same page - or para,\" Mr Jaishankar told the media.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe inability to converge on a joint statement contrasts sharply with the consensus reached by leaders in Bali in November. The G20 leaders' statement had said then that \"most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine\" and noted \"other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions\".India has declined to blame Russia for the war, seeking a diplomatic solution while sharply boosting its purchases of Russian oil. To avoid its year as chair of the G20 becoming dominated by the Ukraine war, India has called for a focus on food, energy and fertilizer security - subjects that impact fewer wealthy nations.",

The first part was launched by BJP National President J P Nadda in Chamarajanagara district on Wednesday.\"Do you know about the young Congress leader, he is being launched now, and for that, they had the Bharat Jodo Yatra. India got divided during partition in 1947, so I thought Rahul Gandhi who was on Bharat Jodo Yatra may go to Karachi or Lahore, but he did not go there,\" Mr Singh said.Addressing a public meeting in Nandagad, he asked as to who did Mr Gandhi try tojodo(unite), when the whole of India is united and together.\"One cannot do politics for long by fooling people, only those who do politics with confidence and maintaining eye contact with the people can be successful, and only those in the BJP can do it,\" he said, as he hit out at the Congress accusing them of using slogans, 'Modi theri kabr khudegi' (Modi your grave will be dug).\"They are not digging Modi's grave, but are digging their own with such slogans. The amount of mud slinging that our Congress friends engage in against BJP and PM Modi, our Lotus will boom that much,\" Mr Singh said.Charging Congress with raising questions on the courage and valour of our defence forces, he asked, \"what happened to them?....As the Defence Minister I want to say, we are proud of our Military forces, the kind of brave deeds they have done, if I say it openly, you will be even more proud.\"Earlier in the day, Mr Singh visited Sangolli Rayanna's memorial and paid respects, following which he launched the Yatre.Sangolli Rayanna (1798-1831) was the army chief of the erstwhile Kittur Kingdom ruled by Rani Chennamma and fought against the British who hanged him to death from a Banyan tree near Nandagad in Belagavi district in 1831.Mr Singh said, this day and this public meeting is good for the BJP as election results for three north eastern states are being declared today, and among them in Tripura and Nagaland the party is forming the government once again, while in Meghalaya it has increased the number of seats.The Defence Minister called on the people to take a resolve to form a BJP government in the state once again, and this time with two-third majority, to build a \"New Karnataka\".Pointing out that after the 2018 Assembly polls as there was no clear majority to any party, BJP could not serve the state for the entire five years term, Mr Singh said, \"it is the wish of the party and its leadership that this time we should get two-third majority in Karnataka and form the government.\"The party veteran from the state B S Yediyurappa has also said that he will put his entire strength and work for BJP getting two-third majority, he said, \"if BJP is given a mandate for full five years, no one can stop Karnataka from becoming the number one state in south of India.\"Noting that Yediyurappa, citing his age and health reasons, decided to quit as CM (in July 2021), Mr Singh said, with his consent Basavaraj Bommai was made the CM.\"When the son of this soil, Yediyurappa resigned voluntarily after serving the state for long, it had to be respected. When Yediyurappa, who has high stature in the party decided to quit as CM, PM Modi and the entire Parliamentary Board decided to make him the member of the Parliamentary Board, which is the highest decision making body,\" he said, adding that Yediyurappa's service can never be forgotten.Highlighting various initiatives of the Modi-led government in the state for the development and progress of Karnataka, the Defence Minister spoke about HAL manufacturing helicopters in Tumakuru, opening of new Airports, and industrial corridors.Claiming that BJP always walks the talk and fulfills the commitment made to the people, he pointed to abrogation of Article 370, and abolition of 'teen talaq\", among others, as he also listed boost to UPI transaction and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) among the achievements of Modi government.He also highlighted India's growing stature globally and it emerging as an economic power, under the current BJP dispensation at the Centre.Averring that the BJP government under PM Modi will not tolerate terrorism and those supporting it, he said, as part of this PFI was banned.The Defence Minister also said that India now produces bombs, tanks, missiles among various other ammunitions required for national security within the country and no longer imports them to the extent earlier.\"We are now into Make in India and Make for the World.\"While Mr Singh flagged off the second yatre today from Nandagad, Union Home Minister Amit Shah is slated to launch the third and fourth yatre from Basavakalyana in Bidar district and Avathy in Devanahalli near Bengaluru, on March 3, in the morning and afternoon, respectively.According to party leaders, more than 50 state and national leaders will take part in this campaign, which will cover all 31 districts and 224 constituencies of the State.The tours will cover 8,000 km, along which the party has planned over 80 rallies, 74 public meetings and about 150 road shows, they said, adding that it is expected to \"touch\" about four crore people.The 20-day long yatre will culminate with a mega rally in the district headquarters town of Davangere on March 25 which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe yatre that will begin from four different places will consist of 10-12 leaders in each of them.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

(File)Kohima:Nagaland political stalwart and its longest serving chief minister Neiphiu Rio is set to assume office as chief minister for a fifth consecutive term after a convincing win for his party and its ally, the BJP.Together, the two parties have secured 33 seats in the 60-member Nagaland assembly.The septuagenarian leader has with this victory, broken the record of veteran leader SC Jamir, who helmed the northeastern state thrice.Mr Rio personally defeated Congress' Seyievelie Sachu, a greenhorn in the political arena, in the Northern Angami II constituency, in the process helping reduce the influence of the grand old party in the state where at one time it was entrenched.Born into an Angami Naga family on November 11, 1950, he received his early education at Kohima's Baptist English School and then went on to study at the Sainik School, Purulia in West Bengal. He later studied at St Joseph's College, Darjeeling and came back to finish his graduation from Kohima Arts College.An active student leader during his school and college days, Mr Rio entered politics at a very young age. He began his nearly five decade long political career as the president of the youth wing of the United Democratic Front in Kohima district in 1974 and later became its Nagaland president.Of the eight state elections he has contested so far, Mr Rio lost only the first one in 1987. He had fought the election then as an Independent aspirant.His political career took an upswing from his second attempt just two years later in 1989, which he made after joining Congress.There was no looking back for him after that first tentative victory and Mr Rio went on to win the subsequent polls. He served his state in various capacities, including being the home minister in SC Jamir's ministry till 2002.That year he, however, quit Congress and was instrumental in reviving the cock symbol of Naga People's Front (NPF).Mr Rio managed to dethrone Mr Jamir and became the chief minister for the first time in 2003. He was, however, dismissed as chief minister when President's Rule was imposed in the state in January 2008.In the next election two months later his party emerged as the single largest one and Mr Rio, was invited to form the government as the leader of NPF-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland.In the next state election in 2013, NPF won a thumping majority and he was re-elected as chief minister for the third term.He continued in the post till 2014 when he decided to resign and venture to the national Parliament. He used to tell reporters that his desire to join national politics stemmed from a \"need\" to be the voice of his people to press the Centre for an early solution to the Naga peace talks.Nonetheless, he resigned from the Lok Sabha on February 9, 2018 and returned to state politics.With the brewing internal differences within his then home party - the NPF, he joined the newly formed Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP).He was chosen to be the NDPP leader and managed to break the then alliance partnership between NPF and BJP. Mr Rio, a master strategist, then contested the 2018 state general elections with a pre-poll agreement with the saffron party.The alliance won 30 seats - 18 by the regional party and 12 by the saffron party and formed the government with the support of 2 NPP MLAs, one from JD(U) and an Independent MLA ending the 15-year reign of NPF in the state.H A Hongnao Konyak, vice-president, Konyak Union (KU), attributed Rio's sustained victory at electoral politics to his expertise at forging alliances.\"He knows that that his party may not be able to sail through on its own. Hence, he enters into carefully thought out alliances.\"Even this time, he continued the alliance with the party in power at the Centre and made them concede majority seats to his NDPP,\" Mr Konyak told PTI.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThis time too, the NDPP-BJP pre-poll alliance has contested the Nagaland poll on the same of 40:20 seat-sharing formula as in 2018 with the understanding that Rio will be the face of its new government.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

BJP will get an absolute majority,\" the BJP stalwart in an exclusive interview with NDTV on Sunday.Before that, in what was seen as his \"farewell speech\" in the Karnataka assembly of which he was a member for decades, Mr Yediyurappa said he would strive towards building the party and bring it to power \"till his last breath\".",

Adani Group has denied all allegations and called them an attack on India.\"I have a lot of respect and admiration for Adani and Adani Group,\" Mr Abbott said at a media briefing here.The coal produced from Adani's Carmichael mines in Australia \"will certainly be part of the ongoing process of electrification here in India\".\"I am all in favour of Adani mine. I thank Adani and his team for what they have done to provide electricity to Indians and jobs and prosperity to Australia,\" he said.In 2015, when a local court revoked the environmental approval for the Adani building one of the world's largest coal mine in Queensland, Abbot had stated that it was \"tragic for a wider world\" if legal safeguards are allowed to stall large mining projects. The group, in 2019, received the final and last approval for the project and coal mined from Carmichael is routinely shipped to Indian power plants to produce electricity.On the allegations by Hindenburg Research, Mr Abbott said that he has not seen the details of the report and \"I assume if there is anything in them, the relevant corporate regulators will do their job\".\"As far as I am concerned I regard Adani as a benefactor to Australia and I admire his success in building up a very large diverse business empire from scratch,\" he said.On India-Australia trade relations, he said the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) implemented between the two countries would help boost economic ties and bilateral trade.\"The existing FTA is good... can it be further developed?. Yes, it can (be) and my understanding is that the trade ministers (of both the countries) will start discussions in coming days (on expanding the scope of the existing trade deal),\" he said.Mr Abbott also said that businesses of both sides should formulate strategies to take advantage of the agreement.\"I will make it my personal mission... to make India a much more important strategic partner of Australia than China,\" the former prime minister said.In recent times, he said it was observed that China is using trade as a weapon against Australia and India would never do anything like that.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"India will always going to be a much more reliable economic partner (than China),\" he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)(Disclaimer: New Delhi Television is a subsidiary of AMG Media Networks Limited, an Adani Group Company.)",

Mr Thackeray (Uddhav) resigns. Governor calls for a floor test for a sitting CM. Floor test doesn't happen. How do you know who would have supported whom? What if one of his coalition partners said sorry we don't want to support you? We don't know.\"And it's not for us to decide as lawyers. This is in the realm of politics. How can your lordships be invited to hazard that guess,\" Salve told the bench, also comprising Justices MR Shah, Krishna Murari, Hima Kohli and PS Narasimha.Contending that everything in the petitions before the top court was \"academic\", Salve submitted that Thackeray never faced the floor test.\"Look at what happened when Shinde came for the floor test in the assembly. Thirteen of Thackeray's hardcore supporters abstained from voting. These things happen in politics. These fast moving political waters take different turns at different points. We're not to speculate,\" Salve said.Admitting that the 10th schedule is not foolproof and there are many \"leaks\" which need to be fixed, Salve said in the present case, everything is academic and the courts cannot go beyond a point.\"There is problem of criminalisation of politics, election funding, spending in elections etc. There are problems but we cannot cross beyond a point,\" he said.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, also appearing for the Shinde faction, argued that there is an artificial distinction sought to be created between the legislative party and the original political party.\"If the government has lost majority and one faction comes and says that we have majority then what error has the governor committed by calling the Shinde faction to be sworn in as the CM?\" he said.The hearing remained inconclusive and will resume on March 14 after Holi vacation.The top court on Wednesday had said Shinde could not have been sworn in as the chief minister of Maharashtra if the assembly speaker was not restrained from deciding the disqualification petitions pending against 39 MLAs.The Shinde faction had told the top court that even if the 39 MLAs would have been disqualified from the assembly, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would have fallen because it had lost majority and the then chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had resigned before the floor test.Kaul had earlier submitted that the Uddhav Thackeray-led faction tried to confuse powers of three constitutional authorities - Governor, Speaker and the Election Commission - and now wants that everything should be set aside, including the floor test on July 4, 2022.On Tuesday, the top court had asked the Shinde-led faction if its move to go against the Shiv Sena party's wish to continue with the coalition in the MVA amounted to indiscipline leading to disqualification.Defending its stand, the Shinde faction said the legislative party is an integral part of the original political party and informed that there were two whips appointed by the party in June last year and it went with the one that said it did not want to continue in the coalition.On February 23, the Uddhav Thackeray faction told the top court that the formation of a new government in Maharashtra under Shinde was the \"direct and inevitable result\" of two orders of the apex court that \"disturbed the co-equal and mutual balance\" between judicial and legislative organs of the State.A political crisis had erupted in Maharashtra after an open revolt in the Shiv Sena and on June 29, 2022, the apex court refused to stay the Maharashtra governor's direction to the 31-month-old MVA government to take a floor test in the assembly to prove its majority.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOn August 23, 2022, a three-judge bench of the top court headed by then chief justice N V Ramana had formulated several questions of law and referred to the five-judge bench petitions filed by the two Sena factions which raised several constitutional questions related to defection, merger and disqualification.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

No doubt, they will be acting as delegates of the Legislature but the exercise of power in such cases would be legislative in nature.\"When an Ordinance is made under Article 123 by the Executive, that is, the Union of India, it is a case of the Executive exercising legislative power. When Parliament adjudges a man guilty of contempt of itself and punishes him, the proceedings are informed by the attribute of judicial power,\" it said.\"The theory that the courts cannot or do not make laws is a myth which has been exploded a long while ago,\" the judgement said.It said there was no \"strict demarcation or separation of powers in India\" as legislature and judiciary have been performing varying roles in a democracy.Giving illustrations, the judgement said when Parliament summons and punishes a person for breach of its privilege then it is performing the role of the judiciary.\"It may be true that the resort to courts is not a remedy for all ills in a society...We are equally cognisant that the courts must not try to run a Government nor behave like emperors,\" it said.It said the separation of powers is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India.\"Equally, judicial review has been recognised as forming a part of the basic structure. Judicial review of legislation is expressly provided in Article 13 of the Constitution,\" it said, adding, \"A court when it declares a law made by the legislature as unconstitutional, if it be that, it is within its bounds, cannot be accused of transgressing the principle of separation of powers.\" Dealing with the court's power of judicial review, it said declaring even a law made by Parliament as unconstitutional forms a part of its powers.\"In view of the enunciation of the doctrine of basic structure in India unlike perhaps in most countries, even an amendment to the Constitution can be declared unconstitutional by the court. Such exercise cannot expose the court to the charge that it is not observing the limits set by the Constitution,\" it said.The theory of separation of powers in an ultimate analysis is meant to prevent tyranny of power flowing from the assumption of excess power in one source, it said.\"Judicial activism, however, must have a sound juridical underpinning and cannot degenerate into a mere exercise of subjectivism,\" it said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

How will Left fight the BJP... How are CPM and Congress claiming to be anti-BJP?\"The reference was to the by-election in Bengal's Sardighi, where the Congress wrested the assembly seat from the ruling Trinamool.The Congress, Left and the BJP all have played the \"communal card\" in Sardighi, Ms Banerjee said. The difference is that the \"BJP has played it openly, but CPM and the Congress have played it to a greater extent\".It was, she said, a lesson that \"we should not listen to CPM or the Congress... The ones that work with BJP, we cannot ally with them\".\"In 2024, we will see an alliance between Trinamool and the people. We will not go with any of the other political parties. We will fight alone with people's support,\" Ms Banerjee added in a statement.Back in 2019, the Bengal leader had been one of the key interlocutors for an opposition alliance.

But not many of her ventures outside the state have brought positive results. The Trinamool failed to open account in Goa and again today in Tripura.

Mr Rohatgi expressed concern that the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee will only lead to a \"political slugfest\".\"Rather than having a Joint Parliamentary Committee and making it a political slugfest, the idea is to look at what are the problems in the system and plug the loopholes,\" Mukul Rohatgi told NDTV in an exclusive interview.The shares of the Adani conglomerate nosedived last month after US-based short selling firm Hindenburg Research alleged a financial fraud and stocks manipulation. The Adani Group has strongly refuted the allegations, calling Hindenburg's report a \"calculated attack\" on India.Earlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court set up a six-member panel to look into regulatory mechanisms to protect investors' interest. The committee, headed by retired judge Abhay Manohar Sapre, will include veteran bankers KV Kamath and OP Bhat, Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani, and retired Justice JP Devdhar\"I think it is appropriate not because of Mr Adani, but because there are millions of share and bond holders, who back particular big businesses. If they have suffered, the court's concern is quite justified,\" Mr Rohatgi said.The selection of names is \"par excellence\" and the remit of the committee is \"wide and sweeping,\" Mr Rohatgi said. \"It is the right thing to instill confidence in the market and people who are in the market,\" he added.The committee is expected to make an overall assessment of the situation, suggest measures to make investors more aware and help strengthen existing regulatory measures for stock markets, the bench led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud has said.The investigation by market regulator SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) will run alongside and should be completed within two months, the court said.Senior lawyer Raian Karanjawala, who represents the Adani Group in several cases, also hailed the formation of the committee.\"It is an excellent decision. The committee meets all the standards that any committee could have met. It has people with high international credentials. The Supreme Court couldn't have chosen a better committee,\" he said.He added that he expects it to be an \"action-oriented committee\" which will give its recommendations \"in a forthright matter\". \"Some part of it might be made public too.

It immediately alerted the Delhi Police which swung into action and arrested five of them.The five accused, identified as Puneet, Mohd Asif, Sunil Kumar, Pankaj Mishar and Vishwa Bhaskar Sharma, acted in close coordination to defraud the company in a very unusual manner, Delhi Police sources said.\"After arrest, when they were interrogated, they disclosed their unique modus operandi. They used to get GST details of these celebrities from Google. They were very well aware that the first two digits of GSTIN are state code and the next 10 digits are PAN number,\" one of the sources said.The source added, \"Since the celebrities date of birth are available on Google, these two -- PAN and date of birth -- complete the PAN details.

After getting this information, they applied for credit cards. During video verification, they were asked questions related to their financial activities which they answered easily as they had got all such details from CIBIL.The source informed that they were aware that these celebrities possibly have good CIBIL scores which would brighten their chances of getting credit cards.\"Also, they were aware that the online verification system cannot identify Abhishek Bachchan as a film star. So the picture of accused Pankaj Mishra with Abhishek Bachchan's PAN and Aadhaar details worked well to get a card issued,\" he added.Further investigation is on and it is suspected that they might have used similar modus operandi to get credit cards from other banks and financial institutions.Police sources also informed that they did online research for several months to find ways to use loopholes in the online verification and issuance of credit cards.The Pune-based FPL Technologies Private Limited issues \"One Card\" which is a contactless metal credit card along with a virtual rendition of the same in the One Card and One Score App \"so that the customer can use it for any online or app-based transactions or purchases,\" the company said in its complaint to the police.The company further alleged that these fraudsters approached the company through their app by uploading the details such as PAN and Aadhaar number to get credit cards issued in their names.The credit limit of the card used to be approved after \"taking into account the bureau details, that is, the information of the customer stored with the credit information companies, for example CIBIL, to establish the genuineness and authenticity of the applicant and its credentials,\" the complaint said.It added, \"They left the original PAN and Aadhaar number and the date of the birth intact and uploaded the forged PAN card/Aadhaar card on our app. Accordingly, our system fetched the bureau details based on the original PAN and suggested a credit limit.\"The company's complaint stated that by misusing the same, \"the accused boarded with us by uploading their real time selfie which matched with the photograph on the forged PAN card/Aadhaar card. Accordingly, credit cards were issued to the accused persons with an approved credit limit of Rs 10 lakh each.\"\"The approved credit limit was exhausted/withdrawn by the accused within a span of a week and nothing has been repaid to us,\" the FIR said.It added, \"We came to know about this fraud when our system got an alert that multiple on boarding attempts were being made using a single device.

A large number of politicians had Pegasus on their phones. I have been called by Intelligence officers who told me, 'Please be careful about what you are saying on the phone because we are sort of recording the stuff'. So this is the constant pressure that we feel. Cases on the Opposition. I have got a number of criminal liable cases for things that should under no circumstances be criminal liable cases. That's what we are trying to defend,\" the Congress leader said in his address.Hitting back at Mr Gandhi, Mr Thakur asked why he did not submit his phone for examination before the Supreme Court-appointed committee, which was set up to look into the snooping allegations against the government.\"What was his compulsion that he could not submit his mobile phone (before the committee) to have it checked for Pegasus spyware? He is already on bail in a (National Herald) corruption case. What was there in his phone that he needed to hide? Why did he and other leaders (who Rahul claims were allegedly spied on) not submit their phones? It has become his habit to defame India on foreign shores,\" Mr Thakur said.While not naming billionaire investor George Soros, who was recently in the news over his statement against Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a security conference in Munich, Mr Thakur said, \"It could be Rahul Gandhi's hatred towards the Prime Minister (that makes him raise such allegations). But it also raises larger questions on the Congress' agenda to defame the country repeatedly from a foreign land, sometimes from a foreign friend. Has Congress lost its faith in our constitutional institutions? Will Congress continue to raise questions about India's democracy? Rahul Gandhi left no stone unturned in defaming India on foreign land.\"Mr Thakur said the Congress MP has Pegasus in his mind and nowhere else.\"As the election results (in Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland) showed yesterday, the Congress has been wiped out again. Hence, this is just Rahul Gandhi ranting against our government in frustration. He knew how his party was going to fare in the elections. Pegasus is in his mind, nowhere else. World leaders are commending India's growth and how the country's image and position has been elevated on the global platform under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If not someone else, Rahul Gandhi could have listened to the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (at the G20 Foreign Ministers' meeting on Thursday). Maybe, Rahul Gandhi could not accept this (Meloni's praise for PM Modi), and neither could he accept the mandate of the people,\" the Union Sports minister said.On Rahul Gandhi allegations of rising attacks on minorities in India, Mr Thakur said the Congress resorted to 'Divide and Rule' when in power, and while the country, under PM Modi, has shed its colonial baggage and mindset, the grand old party doesn't seem to have done the same.\"The Congress has divided people on the basis of caste, religion and community which was born out of a mindset of 'Divide and Rule'. However, the country has now shed this colonial mindset,\" he said.Meanwhile, dismissing the allegations raised by the Congress MP against the government on Friday, Union Telecom minister Ashwni Vaishnaw told ANI, \"What can I say on his remarks? His needle seems to have got stuck somewhere. He needs to move on from this.\"Earlier, in his lecture, Rahul Gandhi had shared a picture of himself in the presentation slide in which he is seen being held by police personnel, claiming that the Opposition leaders were \"locked up\" for \"just standing\" in front of the Parliament House to raise some issues, while also alleging that such incidents have happened \"relatively violently\".\"In the Constitution, India is described as a Union of States, and that Union requires negotiation and conversation. It is that negotiation that is under attack and threat. You can see the picture that was taken in front of our Parliament House. The Opposition leaders, including myself, were just standing there, talking about certain issues, when we were detained and put in jail. That's happened 3 or 4 times. It has happened relatively violently. You have also heard of the attacks on minorities and the press. This does give you a sense of what's going on (in India),\" Rahul Gandhi claimed.In August last year, the Supreme Court-appointed committee to look into snooping allegations against the government concluded that the spyware was not found in the 29 mobile phones examined by it, but malware was found in five mobile phones.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comReading the report of the committee, the bench had said, \"We are concerned about the technical committee report... 29 phones were given and in five phones some malware was found but the technical committee says it cannot be said to be Pegasus.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business, the report added.A 17-member delegation of Foxconn management led by chairman Young Liu visited the campus close to the airport today. \"Bengaluru was the preferred destination for global companies and had been a forerunner in attracting investment, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said. The delegation would fly to New Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the evening.The investment - one of Foxconn's biggest single outlays to date in India - comes amid an accelerating shift by global companies from China as Washington-Beijing tensions grow.Foxconn, however, continues to roll out iPhones from its sprawling assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou where it employs some 200,000 people at the moment.This is Foxconn's second major investment in India. The company is already making the latest generation of iPhones at a site inTamil Nadu.Foxconn, which stands second globally in manufacturing Apple phones, posted an income of 206 billion dollars in 2021. Foxconn is said to be the world's largest electronics manufacturer. As of last year, it ranks 20th in the Fortune Global 500.Foxconn has 173 campuses and offices in 24 countries or regions around the world including China, Japan, Vietnam, the Czech Republic and the US.Post a comment",

Presided over by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, the meeting was attended by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, his Japanese counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi and Australian foreign minister Penny Wong.The meeting came against the backdrop of growing global concerns over increasing Chinese assertiveness in the strategically-vital region.A joint statement issued after the meeting reaffirmed the four-nation grouping's commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and said it strongly supports the principles of rule of law, sovereignty and territorial integrity and peaceful settlement of disputes.Responding to the Quad statement at a media briefing here, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China believes that state-to-state interactions should be in line with the trend of the time which is peace and development rather than exclusivity.\"We think that countries should do more to contribute to regional mutual trust, peace and regional stability,\" she said, reaffirming Beijing's oft-repeated opposition to Quad that it is an exclusive bloc aimed at containing China's rise.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US, and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.US President Joe Biden hosted the first-ever summit of the Quad leaders in the virtual format in March 2021 that vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion, sending a subtle message to China.Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square miles of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory.

We hope the members can respect one another and show solidarity and cooperation rather than division and mutual accusation,\" Mao said.About China's views on the outcome of the New Delhi meeting of the G20 Foreign Ministers, she said: \"We believe the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting is an important forum especially given the international background and challenges\".\"We hope G20 can show responsibility and make due contributions for the world economic recovery and development,\" she said.Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang took part in the meeting.The G20 or Group of 20 is an intergovernmental forum of the world's major developed and developing economies.The members represent around 85 per cent of the global GDP, over 75 per cent of the global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe grouping comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the US and the European Union.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

(Representational)Noida:Three employees of a city-based pharmaceutical firm, whose cough syrup is alleged to have led to the death of 18 children in Uzbekistan last year, were arrested on charges of manufacturing and sale of adulterated drugs, officials said.The arrests were made after an FIR was lodged late Thursday night against five officials of Marion Biotech, including two of its directors, over a complaint by a drugs inspector of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), they said.Police said the directors are at large and a search is underway to apprehend them.Central and Uttar Pradesh drug authorities had checked samples of Marion Biotech products and found 22 of them to be \"not of standard quality\" (adulterated and spurious), according to the complainant drug inspector.\"Three people associated with Marion Biotech, which is located in Sector 67, were today arrested by the local Phase 3 police station officials. These people were engaged in preparation and sale of fake drugs which caused serious harm to public,\" Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Noida) Rajiv Dixit said.\"Besides the three suspects who have been arrested, there are two more directors of the company for whom searches are underway and they will also be arrested soon. With their act, these people were endangering human life and human health,\" Dixit said.The officer added that a comprehensive legal investigation in the case will be carried out.Phase 3 police station in-charge Vijay Kumar said those arrested have been identified as Tuhin Bhattacharya, head operation; Atul Rawat, manufacturing chemist; and Mool Singh, analytical chemist.The directors who are on the run of the firm who have been booked are Jaya Jain and Sachin Jain, Kumar said.The FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 274 (adulteration of drugs), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 276 (sale of drug as a different drug or medical preparation) as well as under section 17 (misbranded drugs) and related violations of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.Marion Biotech had come under the scanner in December last year for its cough syrup Dok-1 that is suspected to have led to the death of 18 children who consumed it in Uzbekistan after which the CDSCO launched a probe into the matter.The production licence of the firm was suspended in January after inspections at its site by the central and the state drug authorities in the wake of the controversy.On January 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) had issued a 'medical product alert', referring to two substandard (contaminated) products, identified in Uzbekistan and reported to it on December 22, 2022.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"The two products are AMBRONOL syrup and DOK-1 Max syrup.

        "text": "Mr Vadakkan noted that the Supreme Court has closed the Pegasus matter. (File)New Delhi:Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remarks at Cambridge University that he was under surveillance triggered a political slugfest on Friday with the BJP accusing him of maligning India on foreign soil and the Congress hitting back by citing instances of Prime Minister Narendra Modi raking up internal politics abroad.Mr Gandhi, who is a visiting fellow of the Cambridge Judge Business School, during a lecture 'Learning to Listen in the 21st Century' on Tuesday evening said Indian democracy is under attack and several politicians, including himself, are under surveillance.Referring to the controversial Pegasus snooping issue, Mr Gandhi alleged that the Israeli spyware was installed on the phones of a large number of politicians, including him.\"I, myself, had Pegasus on my phone. A large number of politicians have Pegasus on their phones. I've been called by intelligence officers who say please be careful what you say on the phone because we are sort of recording this stuff. So, this is a constant pressure that we feel,\" the 52-year-old former Congress chief claimed at the lecture, a video recording of which was posted on Twitter by Congress leader Sam Pitroda, ex-adviser to former prime minister Manmohan Singh.Reacting to the remarks, Union Minister Anurag Thakur hit out at Rahul Gandhi over his claims of being under surveillance by intelligence agencies and accused him of maligning India on foreign soil after facing successive electoral setbacks. \"Pegasus is not in Rahul Gandhi's phone but in his mind,\" he said.Mr Thakur wondered what prevented Mr Gandhi and other Congress leaders from submitting their phones to a Supreme Court-appointed technical committee that probed the Pegasus snooping issue.\"We can understand his hatred towards the prime minister, but the conspiracy to malign the country on foreign soil with the help of foreign friends raises questions on the agenda of the Congress,\" the information and broadcasting minister told reporters here.Anurag Thakur said Mr Gandhi was aware of the electoral rout the Congress was facing in the assembly elections and had resorted to levelling allegations from foreign soil.\"Once again, the Congress lost in the elections but their bankruptcy was evident when they lost no opportunity to malign India from foreign soil,\" he said.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also hit out at Gandhi, calling his speech a \"brazen attempt to denigrate India\" on foreign soil in the \"guise of targeting\" the PM.In a series of tweets, the BJP leader took on the statements made by Rahul Gandhi and claimed that those were not based on facts.\"First foreign agents target us! Then our own targets us on a foreign land!\" Mr Sarma wrote on the micro-blogging site.He maintained that Mr Gandhi's speech at Cambridge was \"nothing but a brazen attempt to denigrate our country on foreign soil in the guise of targeting Adarniya PM Shri @narendramodi ji\".Taking on Mr Gandhi's purported statement that \"Indian democracy is under threat because he can't freely express himself\", Sarma wrote: \"FACT: He travelled 4,000 km in his yatra incident-free under the protection provided by Modi Govt. Do we need to remind him how yatras led by BJP leaders were sabotaged when Cong was in power?\" Referring to Gandhi claiming that spyware Pegasus was found on his phone and an \"officer\" warned him regarding it, the CM maintained that the Congress MP refused to submit his phone for investigation when Supreme Court asked for it.\"Following extensive investigation, SC concluded that there was no evidence of Pegasus,\" he added.Stating that Rahul Gandhi has claimed that \"India's minorities are unsafe and treated like second class citizens\", Sarma wrote: \"FACT: Since May 2014, communal violence in India has been the lowest ever and prosperity of minority families the highest ever. Many minority leaders have reposed their faith in Modi Govt.\" Taking on Gandhi for his apparent praise of China as an aspiring superpower, citing Belt and Road initiative (BRI) as an example, Sarma retorted: \"FACT: BRI is solely responsible for the debt crisis facing several countries today.\" Claiming that Gandhi has admitted that he is fascinated by China and Communist party members have shaped his thoughts, Sarma said, \"Such rich praise for the Chinese is understandable. Gandhi family is trying to pay off its debts for the donations they took from them!\" The leader from the Northeast also took a swipe at Gandhi over his comments on Kashmir militants and Pulwama attack.\"Rahul says in Kashmir militants saw him, but he knew they wouldn't target him. Why was this not reported to security agencies? Was there some understanding Cong had with these militants to protect Rahul?\" Mr Sarma questioned the Congress and its top leader.He maintained that Gandhi's description of the Pulwama attack as a \"car bomb that killed 40 soldiers\" was an insult to the jawans and questioned why he didn't name Pakistan as being behind the incident.\"How dare he insult our jawans? It wasn't a bomb sir, but a terror attack. No surprises that he refused to name Pakistan behind Pulwama attack. Is this part of the understanding Cong had with militants?\" Mr Sarma wrote.Hitting back at Mr Thakur and the BJP for its criticism of Gandhi, the Congress cited instances of Prime Minister Modi going abroad and allegedly raising internal politics and criticising the Congress.\"I have seen those foolish statements given by Anurag 'Golimaaro' Thakur,\" Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said in an apparent reference to the 'Golimaro' slogans purportedly raised at a public meeting of Thakur last year.She urged the information and broadcasting minister him to listen to Mr Gandhi's full lecture.On BJP's criticism that Rahul Gandhi was \"maligning\" the country from foreign soil, Shrinate said the kind of statements Modi had made abroad on internal politics and against the leading Opposition party of the country, if those are recounted then the BJP will have no place to hide.If they listen to Rahul Gandhi's lecture, they would get to know that he has talked about democracy and how the media, judiciary and the Opposition are intimidated and how it is important for agencies to remain impartial, she said.\"He (Gandhi) has talked about strengthening democracy. Those who give statements of 'Golimaaro' from stage and become cabinet minister from minister of state, they can never understand the meaning of these remarks,\" she said.Congress's head of media and publicity department Pawan Khera said the party would like to advise the BJP that they should stop such activities which are shameful to even discuss.\"So if they stop doing such activities, we will stop discussing them. There is an allegation on you (BJP) took the help of Israel to snoop into the phones of Opposition and your own leaders. They don't feel ashamed of that, but if it is discussed they feel shame,\" he said.The BJP thinks that England will not find out about their raid on BBC if the Congress does not discuss it, he said.\"We are living in a different era we are not living in the 17th or 18th century where news travelled at the speed of a camel cart or at the speed of a pigeon. Now if I am talking to you anybody sitting in Papua New Guinea can hear me out,\" Mr Khera said.Earlier, the BJP made light of Rahul Gandhi's allegation that he was being snooped upon, saying the Congress leader was \"hallucinating\" and makes such claims as he wants to create headlines wherever he goes.\"What we can say for Rahul Gandhi's hallucinations. If he makes his (Congress) MoU with China public, we will be interested and people of India will also like to know.

        "text": "The breach of privilege notice dates back to 2004.Lucknow:The Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Friday summoned six policemen to the House and awarded them a day's imprisonment over a lathi-charge on the then BJP MLA Salil Vishnoi and his supporters during a protest nearly two decades back.Pronouncing the verdict in the breach of privileges case, Speaker Satish Mahana told the policemen -- one of whom has retired and others moved up the ranks -- that they had crossed the 'Lakshman Rekha' and sent them to a room in the Vidhan Sabha complex that was deemed to be a cell.This was the first time in 34 years that the House had been turned into a court, an official said.The House Committee of Privileges, which takes up cases where the rights of legislators are targeted, had on Monday recommended punishment for the officers, acting on a breach of privileges notice by the then MLA back in 2004.The quantum of the punishment was to be decided by the House on Friday. The policemen were summoned for this, and also to have their say.Leaders from several parties including the Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress, Apna Dal (Sonelal), Jansatta Dal Loktantrik, Nishad party and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party, authorised the Speaker to take a decision on the matter.Members of the Samajwadi Party, which was in power when the incident took place, and its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal were not not present in the House as the Speaker announced the punishment.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also not there.Speaker Mahana said, \"Those working in government jobs should keep in mind that there is a 'Lakshman Rekha' for them. I believe that all the culprits should be punished with imprisonment. A jail has been made for such people above in the Vidhan Sabha.\" The officers were to be confined there till midnight, but the Speaker made it clear that they should be treated well. He ordered arrangements for food, and other facilities.The last time the UP Assembly witnessed something similar was on March 2, 1989, when an officer of the then UP Terai Vikas Janjati Nigam, Shankar Dutt Ojha, was summoned after being accused of misbehaving with a legislator, an Assembly official said.Mr Vishnoi, now a BJP member of the UP Legislative Council, was leading a delegation to submit a memorandum over power cuts in Kanpur to the district magistrate on September 15, 2004 when the confrontation took place.The privileges notice given by the then MLA the next month said he and the party workers were taking out a silent procession when policemen led by the circle officer hurled abuses at them and charged at them with lathis, injuring half dozen workers.The MLA suffered a leg fracture and was hospitalised under police custody.In the House, the then circle officer Abdul Samad asked for forgiveness -- \"while touching the feet of all of you\" -- for the mistake \"committed knowingly or unknowingly during the discharge of official work\". Another officer promised that there would be no mistakes in the future.Samad is now retired. The five others who appeared in the House are the then Kidwai Nagar SHO Srikant Shukla, then sub-inspector Triloki Singh, and then constables Chote Singh, Vinod Mishra and Meharban Singh.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna said, \"Everyone has tried to apologise but it is very important to maintain the dignity of the legislature in a democracy.Mr Khanna said elected representatives work for the welfare of the public, and policemen do not get the right to use batons and abuse them. He moved a resolution for one day's imprisonment for the police officers.Mahana said the privileges committee had also mentioned the option of suspending the policemen from service, but they have apologised.He said the message from this judgment would go far and wide that constitutional institutions should be respected.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comEarlier, Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi requested the bench to show leniency to the officers, saying the punishment should be for a few hours. But other members opposed this.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The bench noted the trial court found the testimonies of prosecution witnesses were contradictory.New Delhi:The Supreme Court on Friday acquitted a West Bengal resident of the charge of killing his wife 40 years ago, ruling his conviction on the basis of extra-judicial confessions cannot be sustained as it is weak piece of evidence.The top court said where an extra-judicial confession is surrounded by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes doubtful and it loses its importance.The murder was alleged to have taken place on March 11, 1983 in Burdwan district of West Bengal. The trial court decided the case on March 31, 1987, acquitting Nikhil Chandra Mondal, who was booked for allegedly killing his wife.The state government's appeal against the verdict remained pending in Calcutta High Court till December 15, 2008 on which date he was convicted and awarded life sentence.Mondal preferred an appeal before the top court in 2010 against his conviction and sentence, which was decided on Friday.A bench of Justices BR Gavai and Sanjay Karol said, \"The impugned judgment and order dated December 15, 2008 passed by the High Court at Calcutta in Government Appeal...convicting the appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC is quashed and set aside.\" The top court, referring to a 1984 verdict, said it can be seen that this Court has held that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.\"It has been held that the circumstances concerned \"must or should\" and not \"may be\" established. It has been held that there is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between \"may be proved\" and \"must be or should be proved\". It has been held that the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty,\" the bench said.The top court said it has been held that the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one sought to be proved, and that there must be a chain of evidence so complete so as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.\"It is a settled principle of law that however strong a suspicion may be, it cannot take place of a proof beyond reasonable doubt,\" the bench said, and noted the prosecution case rests basically on the extrajudicial confession alleged to have been made by Mondal before three of his fellow villagers, who have been made prosecution witnesses by the police.It said the trial court observed that where the prosecution case is entirely based on extra-judicial confession and the prosecution seeks conviction of the accused on that extra-judicial confession, the evidence of the witnesses before whom the alleged confessional statement was made, requires a greater scrutiny to pass the test of credibility.The bench noted the trial court found the testimonies of prosecution witnesses were contradictory and not trustworthy.\"It is a settled principle of law that extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence. It has been held that where an extra-judicial confession is surrounded by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes doubtful and it loses its importance.\"It has further been held that it is well-settled that it is a rule of caution where the court would generally look for an independent reliable corroboration before placing any reliance upon such extra-judicial confession. It has been held that there is no doubt that conviction can be based on extra-judicial confession, but in the very nature of things, it is a weak piece of evidence,\" the bench said.It said unless the finding of the trial court was found to be perverse, an interference would not be warranted and noted that the trial court found the testimonies of prosecution witnesses not reliable so as to base the conviction solely on such testimonies.\"We find that the approach adopted by the trial court was in accordance with law. However, this circumstance which, in our view, could not have been used has been employed by the High Court to seek corroboration to the extra-judicial confession,\" the bench said, adding the scope of interference in an appeal against acquittal is very well crystalised that unless such a finding is found to be perverse or illegal/impossible, it is not permissible for the appellate Court to interfere with the same.The top court directed Mondal to be set at liberty forthwith unless required in any other case and upheld the trial court verdict dated March 31, 1987 acquitting him of murder charges.On March 11, 1983, a case was registered at Ketugram police station of Burdwan district that the body of an unknown married woman aged 25 years was lying in a field on the side of the railway track at Ambalgisan railway station.Police found that the woman, identified as Mondal's wife, was killed with a sharp edged weapon.

(Representational)New Delhi:The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the release of a 20-year-old man, who was awarded the death penalty for rape and murder of a four-year-old child in Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh in 2017, after holding he was juvenile when the offence was committed.A bench of Justices BR Gavai, Vikram Nath and Sanjay Karol said, \"The conviction of the appellant (youth) is upheld; however, the sentence is set aside\".It said since the appellant at present would be more than 20 years old, there was no requirement of sending him to the Juvenile Justice Board or any other child care facility or institution.\"Appellant is in judicial custody. He shall be released forthwith,\" the bench said and modified the November 15, 2018 order of the Indore bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court by which it had confirmed his conviction and death sentence in the case.The top court, which passed the verdict on the appeal of the youth, had ordered an inquiry by the trial court into the juvenility claim made by him.\"We have perused the report and also the material evidence led before the Trial Court on the basis of which the conclusion has been drawn by the Trial Court. The report is based upon documentary evidence as also oral evidence of the present head-mistress, the retired headmaster, five teachers of the primary institution and also the guardian of the appellant,\" the bench said.It said it would also be pertinent to note that the institution is not a private institution but a government primary school and this court does not find any reason to disbelieve or even doubt the testimony of government servants both working and retired.\"In addition to the mark sheets by the institution, there is also the date of birth certificate issued by the institution. Further, the original Scholar register and other documents were also produced before the Trial Court in the inquiry.\"This Court, therefore, has no reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court regarding the date of birth of the appellant. We, therefore, accept the report of the Trial Court and hold that the appellant was aged 15 years, 4 months and 20 days on the date of the incident,\" the bench held.The top court rejected the plea of the state government that the accused be sent for ossification test to ascertain his claim of juvenility on the ground that the state has not raised any objection during the inquiry done by the trial court.\"Secondly, ossification test will only give a broad assessment of the age. It cannot give an exact age. There is also an element of margin of plus or minus 1 to 2 years. Even if we permit the said test, it does not lead us anywhere. It will have no bearing on the assessment made by the Trial Court after the inquiry,\" it said.Referring to the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, the bench said the law provides full coverage to a person who is established to be a child on the date of the offence to avail the benefits admissible to a child under the law, even if the case has been finally decided and also such person has attained majority.It said that sub-section (3) provides that if it is found in the inquiry that such person was a child on the date of commission of such offence, then the Court is required to forward the child to the Juvenile Justice Board for passing appropriate orders and further if any sentence has been imposed by the Court, the same shall be deemed to have no effect.\"In view of the above statutory provisions and in view of the findings recorded, the appellant having been held to be a child on the date of commission of the offence, the sentence imposed has to be made ineffective,\" the bench said.Dealing with the conviction of the youth by the trial court and later affirmed by the high court, the bench said that having considered the statutory provisions laid down in the 2015 Act, \"we are of the view that merits of the conviction could be tested and the conviction which was recorded cannot be held to be vitiated in law merely because the inquiry was not conducted by JJB\".It said the object under the 2015 Act dealing with the rights and liberties of the juvenile is only to ensure that if he or she could be brought into the main stream by awarding lesser sentence and also directing for other facilities for welfare of the juvenile in conflict with law during his stay in any of the institutions defined under the 2015 Act.\"The intention of the legislature was to give benefit to a person who is declared to be a child on the date of the offence only with respect to its sentence part.\"If the conviction was also to be made ineffective then either the jurisdiction of regular Sessions Court would have been completely excluded not only under section 9 of the 2015 Act but also under section 25 of the 2015 Act, provision would have been made that on a finding being recorded that the person being tried is a child, a pending trial should also be relegated to the JJB and also that such trial would be held to be null and void,\" it said.On December 15, 2017, the four-year-old went missing while playing with her friends outside her house in Dhar district. Her parents filed a missing person's complaint but the child's mutilated and nude body was found the next morning a few metres away from her house. Police said she was bludgeoned to death with a stone.Upon investigation, police questioned people in the vicinity and detained the youth, whose statements were found to be inconsistent.The trial was fast-tracked and he was held guilty and sentenced to death by the lower court on May 17, 2018.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comUnder the Juvenile Justice Act, if a child above 16 but below 18 years of age has committed a heinous offence, he or she will be tried as an adult.

        "text": "The state government sought some time to come up with a list of routes for the march.New Delhi:The Tamil Nadu government told the Supreme Court on Friday it is not completely opposed to allowing the RSS' route marches and public meetings across the state on March 5 but cited intelligence reports to say these cannot be held in every street or locality.The state government sought some time to come up with a list of routes for the march.Granting the prayer of senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the state government, a bench of Justices V Ramasubramanian and Pankaj Mittal deferred the hearing till March 17.Mr Rohatgi said the state will try and work out a solution and decide the routes it wanted the processions to take by then.\"The idea is not to ban the processions but it needs to have some conditions,\" he said.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for the RSS, said the state has allowed similar events by organisations like the 'Dalit Panthers' but the RSS was being singled out for harsh treatment.The RSS, he said, was allowed to conduct marches in six districts which it did. However, it has been asked to hold the event in enclosed spaces in 42 places.\"In the areas where we were allowed, we went ahead and there was no law and order problem. Now, they say that the PFI has been banned by the central government and it is a threat (to RSS events). They are not able to control a terrorist organisation and that is why they are banning us. I cannot exercise my right. Can this be a ground?\" Jethmalani said.Jethmalani said that on March 5, the RSS is not going to hold the march anyway and, if the state wants time, there is no difficulty.\"We are not going to do anything till at least March 10 or 12, even a week later if my friends want,'' he said.At the outset, Rohatgi told the bench that though the state has challenged the order dated February 10 of the high court allowing the route march, it is not totally opposed to the events.\"However, the march cannot be held in every street and every mohalla (locality). We have considered the situations of every locality. We have some intelligence reports. We have border areas with some history of disturbances, like there were bomb blasts. We have said that it cannot be done in absolute fashion in areas like Coimbatore.\"The Popular Font of India (PFI) has been banned. So, we said don't do it in disturbed areas in the open but do it in enclosed compounds,\" he said.Responding to Rohatgi's contention, Justice Ramasubramanian said when he was a judge in the Madras High Court, he had passed orders for processions in cases involving the RSS and an organisation was dead against allowing such events.\"I had passed a similar order like it is passed now by the High Court,\" he said, adding, \"One is language of democracy and one is language of power. Which language you speak depends on where you are...\".Rohatgi added the high court had said let the marches be held wherever the RSS wanted.\"Maintenance of law and order is up to the state. They (the RSS) cannot have a carte blanche order to hold marches in whatever areas they want. We have given the list of areas with disturbances in a sealed cover to the high court,\" he said and read out the single-judge bench order of the high court which allowed RSS processions with some conditions.Rohatgi asserted nobody can say he has a vested right to hold processions in every street of the state and the state plea cannot be shut out on grounds of technicalities.\"Now the problem is that they are to hold the procession on March 5, two days before Holi. This court may protect me for a few days. I am not fully opposed to the procession but on the manner in which it is supposed to be done,\" he submitted, adding the court may post the matter after a few days. He said it is not that March 5 is a sacrosanct day and that he will submit some relevant documents to the court.The state government, in its plea before the top court, said the route march will pose a law and order problem and sought a stay on the high court order.Setting aside the order passed on November 4, 2022 by a single judge bench which had imposed conditions on the proposed state-wide route marches asking the RSS to hold the events indoor or in enclosed space, a division bench had restored the order dated September 22, 2022 which directed the Tamil Nadu police to consider the RSS' representation and grant permission to conduct the programmes without conditions.Accordingly, it had directed the RSS to approach the state authorities with three different dates of their choice for the purpose of holding the route march/peaceful procession and the state authorities were asked to grant permission to them on one of the chosen dates.Also, the RSS was asked to ensure strict discipline and make sure there is no provocation or incitement on their part during the marches.Challenging the single judge order, the RSS had sought a direction to the authorities to permit their members to hold the procession wearing their uniform throughout the state.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe organisation had earlier sought permission for the route march to commemorate the 75th year of Independence, the birth centenary of Bharat Ratna B R Ambedkar and Vijayadasami festival on October 2, 2022.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

And the answer is not simple, the answer is a little complex. And I hope it has a gem of truth,\" the Chief Justice said.\"The seeds of our institutions today in terms of inclusion, diversity reflect the state of the profession, say two decades ago.

Today, whether true or false, investor sentiment has been damaged by such occurrences of market volatility and to build it back we need to know quickly what exactly happened,\" Mr Salve told NDTV.The Supreme Court yesterday set up a six-member committee of experts to look into issues arising out of the Adani group firms' stock crash triggered by US short seller Hindenburg's allegations.Mr Salve, welcoming the formation of the committee, said the Adani-Hindenburg row involves some complex financial matters that only subject matter experts can handle.\"The JPC (joint parliamentary committee) consists of MPs who are very wise people. Here, what has happened is in an area - a very specialised field. What has happened here is there are allegations made on structuring of companies, allegations made about how shares have been issued, how shares have been overvalued, how the market has been played,\" Mr Salve said.\"This is a very specialised field. Justice Sapre brings an experience - he has been a commercial lawyer, we have worked together... He was in the SAT (Securities Appellate Tribunal). So is Somasekharan Sundaresan. He knows the subject. He knows this law better than most lawyers do. He can teach me this law. He is that good,\" Mr Salve said, referring to the composition of the six-member committee - former Supreme Court judge Justice AM Sapre, former SBI chairman OP Bhat, retired Bombay High Court judge Justice JP Devadhar, former Infosys chairman KV Kamat, Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani and lawyer Somasekharan Sundaresan, who is also a securities and regulatory expert.Adani group has called Hindenburg Research's report an \"attack on India\"\"People like them will look at what is going on in the market and what exactly has happened and you will have that report. And after that, if the report convinces you that there has been a political cover-up, then you should demand action in parliament, debate in parliament, joint parliamentary committee (JPC). Today, the demand for a JPC is only to embarrass the government and the noises will become more shrill as 2024 comes closer,\" Mr Salve said, referring to the national election scheduled next year.\"There are two things - one is the allegations made by the Hindenburg report. They may be right, they may be wrong - Adani is my client, you know that - we will defend the allegations etc, but there is a completely different dimension to this. Hindenburg is no Good Samaritan who has exposed wrongdoings. They have timed the report, they have dropped the report, they do it for shorting,\" Mr Salve said.\"It is my suggestion and I have said so publicly, and I am repeating that the committee must find all those who have made tonnes of money at the cost of the middle class investor by shorting shares. Treat that as market manipulation and get them to disgorge and ban them from trading,\" the senior lawyer told NDTV.Adani group firms' shares fell sharply after the report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research\"India is new to this game. We are growing our capital markets. If the middle class investor is petrified that every time he invests in a company, tomorrow there's a Hindenburg report, by the time it is proved to be false it's too late. The shares have tanked anyway,\" Mr Salve said, adding India must have some institutional mechanism to hold to account people who are systematically making money off the misfortune of the middle class shareholders.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comEven among opposition parties, there is difference of opinion on the new committee. The Congress and its allies want a JPC, with its leader Rahul Gandhi singularly focussing on this issue.

About half of all inpatient severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and outpatient influenza-like illnesses were found to have influenced A H3N2.Emphasising about the clinical features of Influenza A H3N2, ICMR has said that this subtype appears to cause more hospitalizations than other influenza subtypes.\"Out of the hospitalized SARI patients with influenza A H3N2, about 92 per cent are suffering from fever, 86 per cent from cough, 27 per cent from breathlessness, 16 per cent with wheezing, and additionally, 16 per cent had clinical signs of pneumonia and 6 per cent has seizures. Also, 10 per cent of SARI patients who have H3N2 needed oxygen, and 7 per cent required ICU care,\" ICMR stated.ICMR has also suggested people wash their hands regularly and avoid shaking hands and spitting in public.\"The Dos include washing hands with soap and water. If symptomatic, wear masks and avoid crowded places, cover mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, take plenty of fluids, avoid touching eyes and nose, and take paracetamol for fever and body ache,\" ICMR stated.It further added, \"The Don'ts include shaking hands or using other contact greetings, spitting in public, taking antibiotics or other medicines without consulting a doctor, eating together sitting close to others.\"Notably, ANI was the first to report about the prevalence of H3N2 in January.According to Dr Arjun Dang, CEO, Dr Dangs Lab, H3N2 Influenza cases are being reported more in comparison to H1N1.He said, \"In the past few weeks, we've gotten more than a few 100 tests out of which a lot of them are positive for H3N2. But it's interesting to see that we are getting less H1N1 positive.\"Dr Sameer Bhati, Public Health Expert, and Director, Star imaging and path lab said, \"We have observed an increase in Flu cases where H3N2 is found majorly after diagnosis. We do RT PCR for its confirmation where RNA is extracted from the samples and then it is amplified using RT PCR technology.\"\"The results are interpreted on the basis of specific fluroscent dye for each Infuenza viruses like H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9. Generally, when H3N2 dominates the flu cases, the cases are severe for people in At-Risk Groups like older adults & younger children while people with chronic medical issues have more chances of experiencing flu complications due to weak immune systems and may also require hospitalisation,\" he further said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The incident scarred him for life, something that he has written about in his just released autobiographical novel \"Tumhari Auqaat Kya Hai Piyush Mishra\".Mr Mishra says he has changed only the names and kept the truth intact in his book, published by Rajkamal Prakashan, as \"revenge\" was not his purpose.\"It left me shocked, I was surprised at what had happened,\" Mr Mishra told PTI while reflecting on the incident that had happened when he was studying in the 7th standard.\"Sex is such a healthy thing that your first encounter with it should be good, otherwise it scars you for life, it disturbs you for life. That sexual assault gave me complex throughout my life and it took me a long time and several partners to come out of it,\" the multi-hyphnate personality said.The book that traces his journey from narrow alleys of Gwalior to Delhi's cultural centre of Mandi House and eventually to Mumbai.\"I wanted to hide the identity of some people. Some of them are women, and some men who are now well established in the film industry. I did not want to take revenge against anybody, or to hurt anyone.\" In the book, the noted actor, singer, and composer narrates his life through the autobiographical character of Santap Trivedi, or Hamlet, as he was known in his alma mater, the National School of Drama (NSD).Hailing from a middle class family in Gwalior, Piyush Mishra showed promise as a multidimensional artiste from his childhood by quickly taking to vocal and instrumental music, paintings, sculptures, poetry and eventually theatre.According to the book, even as his father pressured him to pursue a career in medical science, Mr Mishra dropped out and decided to join NSD at the age of 20. It would start a lifelong romance with theatre and acting.Initially reluctant to leave Delhi while friends went on to establish careers in Mumbai, Piyush Mishra eventually made the shift to the city of dreams in early 2000s.He quickly made his mark as an actor, songwriter, singer, scriptwriter in films such as Vishal Bhardwaj's \"Maqbool\" (2004), Anurag Kashyap's \"Gulaal\" (2009) and most notably, \"Gangs of Wasseypur in 2012, where he played the narrator.Not just his acting, Mr Mishra's songs have also connected with listeners, especially the younger generation. And the lyricist and singer of music band 'Ballimaaraan' is surprised by the recall value some of his songs have.\"Maybe it is the way I say things that connects me with the youth, or that I talk about them, their issues... It is also possible that they see in me somebody who doesn't use heavy words and that I don't carry an air of superiority around me. And the more I can relate with them the better for me,\" he said.Piyush Mishra has written, composed and sung for films like \"Gulaal\" and \"Gangs of Wasseypur\". His earlier songs \"Ghar\", written for a theatrical adaptation of West Side Story - \"Jab Shehar Hamara Sota Hai\", and \"Husna\" were later featured by international music franchise Coke Studio.But, who does he listen to? While Kishore Kumar is the top favourite, ghazal legends like Mehdi Hasan, Ghulam Ali and Jagjit Singh also feature in his playlist, the artiste said.Having fiddled with and excelled at different aspects of film and theatre, the singer-songwriter has set himself a new milestone to achieve - film direction.\"I wanted to write a novel for a long time, but now it is out of the way. I don't want to stay as a music director, neither do I want to sing. I don't want to just act... Now, I have film direction on my mind. That is something I want to explore. Let's see when that happens,\" the 60-year-old theatre veteran said.Mr Mishra is happy that he has not been typecast as an actor and credits his selective nature for that.\"I don't think I have been typecast because I have always done different roles no matter their size. I had small but different roles in 'Tamasha', 'Rockstar', 'Maqbool', 'Gulaal' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur'. \"I don't have a problem in getting roles. I keep rejecting a lot of stuff. I turn down roles that I feel I won't enjoy.\" On a question about his days in NSD and how the institute is faring now, Mishra said like everything else, the premiere theatre school is also facing decline.\"What do I say, everything goes through a decline and that's the case with every educational institute in India. What we had 30 years ago is no longer there... There are big walls around the campus now. That was not the case when we were studying.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"We would climb the wall for a tea outing or to eat 'bhutta'. But these things have disappeared now.

Hindenburg is no Good Samaritan who has exposed wrongdoing. They have timed the report, they have dropped the report. They do it for shorting,\" Mr Salve told NDTV on Friday.\"It is my suggestion - I have said this publicly and I am repeating that - the committee must find out all those who have made tonnes of money at the cost of the middle class investor by shorting shares,\" he said, referring to a six-member committee set up by the Supreme Court to investigate the Adani group-Hindenburg row.\"Treat that as market manipulation and get them to disgorge and ban them from trading.

The middle class investor is petrified that every time he lists in a company, tomorrow if there is another Hindenburg report - by the time it is proved to be false, it is too late, your shares have tanked anyway. We must have some institutional mechanism to say that the people who are making money off this misfortune of the middleclass shareholders are held to account,\" Mr Salve said.Mr Salve, welcoming the formation of the committee, said the Adani-Hindenburg row involves some complex financial matters that only subject matter experts can handle.\"The JPC (joint parliamentary committee) consists of MPs who are very wise people.

So, we are going through all the states and Kashmir is a state which is insurgency prone. There is a lot of violence there ... There was a lot of violence for many years. As I am entering Kashmir, the security guys come to me and say, 'Listen, we need to talk to you. Look the thing is you cannot walk in Kashmir. It is not a good idea.' We are walking for three days, in the roughest districts. They said you cannot walk in Kashmir, it is a bad idea. I said, 'Why cannot I walk in Kashmir?' They are like, 'Well, you will get hand grenades thrown at you.' Now I am responsible for 120 people I am walking with.\"The Congress MP further said, \"I said let me go and have a little word with them. So, I go and have a little word with them. I told them, 'Look, they are telling us that hand grenades are going to get thrown at us.' I was like, 'Frankly I want to walk. If we get hand grenades, we get hand grenades.' So, they were like, yes, we should all walk. So, we decided we are going to walk. And we started to walk and suddenly what starts to happen is that these Indian flags start coming out everywhere.He said he had to sit on a jeep in between the police and security system were overloaded and collapsed.\"The first day, we were told about 2,000 people were going to show up and 40,000 people showed up. I am sitting on that jeep because the police and security system were just overloaded and collapsed. Because they could not manage the crowd.\"\"Then the really interesting thing happened. So, we have been told we are going to be killed. And we are walking. And people are coming and one guy looks at me and he says, 'Call me. So, I am like, 'Come' ... And the security people said, 'Please do not do this ... please do not call people, because it is putting everyone at risk.' So, he comes and he starts walking next to me. And, he says, 'Mr Gandhi, you have come here to listen to us.' I am like, 'yes'. He said, 'That is interesting.' He is like, 'You really come here to listen to us.' I am like, 'yes' and he is like good. And then he says, 'You see those guys over there?' And we are walking. I ask, 'Who?' He says, 'Those boys over there.' He is like, 'They are militants.' Now militants should normally kill me.\"\"In that environment, militants should kill me. He says they are there and they are looking at you. So, I look at them and they are giving me this sort of look and I am like, okay, I am now in trouble because this guy has just told me this ... They give me this look and I give them this look back and then we carry on. Nothing happens. Why I am telling you this is because they actually could not do anything. They actually did not have the power to do anything even if they wanted to. Because I had come into that environment listening. And I had come into that environment completely with no violence in me at all. And a vast number of people there were saying that. That to me was an indicator of power of listening and non-violence,\" Rahul Gandhi added.Rahul Gandhi launched a scathing attack at the Centre during the lecture at Cambridge University, alleging that an attack has been unleashed on the basic structure of Indian democracy while also claiming that Israeli spyware Pegasus was being used to snoop into his phone.Rahul Gandhi claimed that he had been warned by the intelligence officers to be \"careful\" while speaking on the phone as his calls were being recorded.\"I myself had Pegasus on my phone. A large number of politicians had Pegasus on their phones. I have been called by intelligence officers who told me, 'Please be careful about what you are saying on the phone because we are sort of recording the stuff. So this is the constant pressure that we feel. Cases on the Opposition. I have got a number of criminal liable cases for things that should under no circumstances be criminal liable cases. That's what we are trying to defend,\" the Congress leader said in his address.Rahul Gandhi alleged further that constraints were being put on the Parliament, press and the Judiciary in the country.\"Everybody knows and it's been in the news a lot that Indian democracy is under pressure and under attack. I am an Opposition leader in India, we are navigating that (Opposition) space. The institutional framework which is required for a democracy -- Parliament, free press, the judiciary, just the idea of mobilisation, moving around -- all are getting constrained. So, we are facing an attack on the basic structure of Indian democracy,\" the Congress MP alleged.Sharing a picture of himself in the presentation slide in which he is seen being held by the police personnel, the Congress leader claimed that the Opposition leaders were \"locked up\" in jail for \"just standing\" in front of the Parliament House to talk about some issues, while also alleging that such incidents have happened \"relatively violently\".\"In the Constitution, India is described as a Union of States, and that Union requires negotiation and conversation. It is that negotiation that is under attack and threat. You can see the picture which is taken in front of Parliament House. The Opposition leaders were just standing there talking about certain issues, and we were put in jail. That's happened 3 or 4 times. It has happened relatively violently. You have also heard of the attacks on minorities and the press. You get a sense of what is going on,\" Rahul Gandhi claimed.Notably, Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Yatra traversed 12 states and two Union territories in 145 days after its launch on September 7 last year and covered 4,080 km.The yatra culminated with an event at the Congress headquarters in Srinagar and a mega rally on January 30.Congress claimed that Bharat Jodo Yatra was the longest march on foot by any Indian politician in the history of India. The party said it received support from various political parties and social organizations across the country.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comCongress suffered a debacle in the assembly polls held last year and the Yatra was seen as an attempt to encourage the party rank and file for the upcoming electoral battles.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

While even Pakistan no longer dares say these things about India on a global forum, Gandhi is presenting it as a place where democracy is no longer there and the judiciary has been compromised,\" he said.Mr Patra questioned if Gandhi was working as an agent on the payroll of an agency to bring down India.At a lecture at Cambridge University, Mr Gandhi had alleged that Indian democracy is under attack and several politicians, including himself, are under surveillance.The former Congress president listed five key aspects of the alleged attack on Indian democracy -- capture and control of media and judiciary; surveillance and intimidation; coercion by federal law enforcement agencies; attacks on minorities, Dalits and tribals; and shutting down of dissent.Mr Patra said the Congress leader spoke about minorities being treated as second-class citizens and alleged \"Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family can stoop to any low to destroy the fabric of India.\" \"Just because you are not a bright kid and not a bright kid of your dynastic party doesn't mean India is not a bright spot,\" he said, hitting back at the Congress leader.Mr Patra said Mr Gandhi or other Congress leaders did not even submit their mobile phones for inspection by a probe committee set by the Supreme Court to look into the charge of snooping through the Pegasus malware.He said an RTI reply had revealed that thousands of phones were tapped and hundreds of emails read by government agencies when the UPA was in power and recalled that former president Pranab Mukherjee, then a Cabinet minister, had suspected that his office was bugged at the behest of another minister.The BJP leader said Gandhi spoke about thrust on harmony and nationalism in China, and accused him of seeing India as an \"agreement\" and not a nation.He spoke of the role of the Yellow River in building Chinese nationalism but could not see the Ganga in India, Mr Patra said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMr Patra slammed Mr Gandhi for his remarks at a time when India was hosting the G20, with world leaders recognising the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

We will give a corruption-free government. We will give free electricity, build good government schools and provide quality education,\" Mr Kejriwal said.Assembly elections are due in Karnataka by May.The AAP chief alleged that corruption in the state doubled since the last assembly polls in 2018 and urged the people to vote in a 'new engine' government by throwing out the 'double-engine' regime of the BJP.Taking a dig at the ruling BJP in Karnataka, Arvind Kejriwal alleged that there is a 40 per cent commission government running in the state.\"The people of Karnataka are good but the leaders are not. They defamed and destroyed the state before the world. There is a 40 per cent commission government here in which 40 per cent cut is taken in every public work,\" the Delhi Chief Minister alleged.In this context, he mentioned the recovery of Rs 8.23 crore unaccounted cash from Channagiri BJP MLA Madal Virupakshappa's son Prashanth Kumar M V.\"Recently, Union Home Minister Amit Shah came to Karnataka and appealed to the people to give absolute majority in the upcoming assembly election so that a corruption-free government can be established in the state. Then, someone reminded him that already there is a BJP government in the state. I want to ask him why you could not eradicate corruption in the last four years,\" the Delhi Chief Minister said.He said the very next day after Shah flew back to Delhi, a BJP MLA's son was caught with crores of unaccounted cash.\"That MLA and his son who hail from Davangere have not been arrested yet.

You too become honest just like us,\" the AAP supremo quipped.Stating that AAP is a 'staunch honest' party, Arvind Kejriwal said raids never led to any recovery.The Delhi Chief Minister said during the 2018 assembly elections in Karnataka, there was a '20 per cent commission government' in the state.\"The Prime Minister came to Karnataka and alleged that there is a 20 per cent commission government (during 2018 polls). He assured that he will eradicate corruption if the 'double-engine government' is formed in the state,\" the AAP chief said.He added that people trusted the Prime Minister's words and formed the 'double engine government' (BJP government in the Centre and the state).Corruption doubled in the state from 20 per cent to 40 per cent commission, the Delhi Chief Minister alleged.Mr Kejriwal said: \"I will tour across the country and tell everyone not to form the double engine government. Corruption doubles in double-engine government. We need a new engine government.\" BJP MLA Virupakshappa has been booked while his son Prashanth, a government officer, was arrested by Lokayukta following raids in several places in the state.The AAP chief added that the state contractors' association president Kempanna wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the ministers in Karnataka are demanding 40 per cent commission.Instead of addressing the octogenarian office-bearer's grievance or taking action against the ministers and MLAs, the 82-year-old contractor was arrested in a defamation case, Mr Kejriwal alleged.The Delhi Chief Minister charged that 40 per cent commission is charged from contractors, private unaided schools and Maths (hermitage).Arvind Kejriwal said in the last five years, Rs 20,000 crore was spent on repairing the pothole ridden Bengaluru roads but not even 20 potholes were filled.Due to this indifferent government, over 100 people lost their lives due to potholes, he claimed.Highlighting the corruption prevailing in the state, Mr Kejriwal said bribes are taken to recruit police sub-inspectors and lecturers.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Even the MLAs are on sale.

        "text": "Mr Sibal said he was not going to form any political party. (File)New Delhi:Alleging that a government working against the citizens is at the helm, Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal on Saturday announced a new platform 'Insaaf' to fight \"injustice\" prevailing in the country and called on everyone, including Opposition parties' chief ministers and leaders, to support him in his endeavour.Mr Sibal said he would hold a public meeting of the new platform at Jantar Mantar on March 11 and will put forward a new vision of India there. He said it was an open invitation for everyone, including opposition leaders and common people, to join him at the event.\"Will give a new vision of India, a positive agenda. Main koi Modi ji ko criticise nahi karne baitha, main unko sudhaar doonga (I am not here to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but will reform him),\" he said at a press conference at his residence.Kapil Sibal alleged that injustice is prevailing in every nook and corner of India.Injustice is being done to citizens, institutions, political Opposition, journalists, teachers, and medium and small businesses, he claimed.\"We have started a website 'Insaaf ke Sipahi' where anyone can register. This will be a national level platform where lawyers will be at the forefront,\" the former Congress leader said.\"It is with great deliberation that I have decided that people need to be awakened and asked to become our 'Insaaf ke Sipahi' and wherever injustice is happening, they should fight it. I want all Opposition chief ministers and leaders to support me in this endeavour and we start a national movement to free ourselves from this slavery,\" he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said efforts will be made to bring Opposition leaders and parties to jointly fight injustice in the country, but asserted that his motives were not political but to fight for constitutional values.The initiative by Mr Sibal, an Independent Rajya Sabha MP who is considered an important voice of the Opposition, and his talk of bringing parties and leaders together for the \"fight against injustice\" comes amid a crack in Opposition ranks with the Congress and Trinamool Congress (TMC) trading barbs repeatedly.\"Through you (media) I am requesting everyone to be part of this, then we will take this forward,\" he said.Responding to a question, Mr Sibal said he wants the Congress also to join the initiative but asserted that this was aimed at being a people's movement and he was not going to form any political party.Sibal said common people and lawyers together will fight against injustice through this initiative.\"The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) shakhas spread their ideology in every locality and that ideology also gives rise to injustice in certain cases. We will fight that injustice also. We want that in every nook and corner of the country 'insaaf ke sipahi' stand up and fight,\" he said.The former Union minister also launched a scathing attack on the BJP-led government at the Centre, accusing it to working to finish off political Opposition with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) acting as its \"valentine\".Citing the Premable of the Constitution, Mr Sibal said though India's sovereignty will always remain, it was not moving on the path of socialism, democracy was on the decline and there were also questions over the Republic.The Constitution also promised social, economic and political justice, he pointed out, alleging that there was \"injustice\" prevailing on all the three fronts.Talking about political injustice, Kapil Sibal said the Xth Schedule of the Constitution that deals with the anti-defection law has become a \"defector's paradise\".\"After 2014, they (the BJP) have toppled eight governments be it in Meghalaya, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh or Maharashtra. Tell me if there is any other country where elected governments are toppled through inducements and buying of legislators. Courts, lawyers and people are silent, this is political injustice,\" he said.About 100 people in this country have assets worth Rs 54 lakh crore, Kapil Sibal claimed and asked if this was economic justice.\"In 2018, 190 million people were poor and in 2022, the number of poor increased to 350 million,\" he said.\"The government valentine is ED. You put it behind anyone and coerce that person. CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) still needs the nod of the state government but not the ED,\" the senior advocate pointed out.\"The fact of the matter is that we are in a situation that we see a government versus the citizens. We want a government for citizens not versus citizens,\" Kapil Sibal asserted.The ED has acted against 121 people in recent times out of which 115 belong to the Opposition, he said.Such violence is prevailing in the country and until common people rise to fight it, \"we are in for a difficult time\", Mr Sibal said.\"There are some good things about every administration. If I say that what Modi ji is doing everything is wrong even that is not right. Digitalisation is right, 'Awas Yojana' is right, there are several policies, we are not against that. But wherever people's voice is suppressed and wherever injustice is being done, we are against it,\" he said.On the 'Insaaf' platform, he asserted that this was not political but about justice, asserting that no one will oppose this including Modi.Asked about forging Opposition unity through this initiative, Mr Sibal said he will make efforts and take it forward.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"I will ask Opposition parties' CMs and wherever not in government, their leaders to go to various states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand Chhattisgarh, to Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh and talk about justice,\" Kapil Sibal said that he was only acting as a \"facilitating factor\" for the 'Insaaf' initiative.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Thanks to that deal that removed tariffs on Australian coal. Obviously, there's more to energy markets than just coal.

I admire the way Adani and his team have shown perseverance in Australia. As for the claims that have been made about various market dealings and so on, I'm confident that if there is anything in them, it will be referred to the relevant regulator, who will deal with it because Adani is a company that operates under the law. India is a country that operates under the rule of law,\" Mr Abbott said.Adani Mining's flagship development is the Carmichael mine and rail project, located some 300 km west of the Queensland coast.

Bills pending in Rajya Sabha are put in the \"live register\" and remain pending.\"If we want to grow at par with other nations, we demand that the Women's Reservation Bill be introduced in this session of Parliament. We feel, in women empowerment, political empowerment is a critical aspect. Everyone is talking but no one is protesting on the ground. We want to do it for the women and we are committed for it,\" the BRS MLC said.Referring to the BJP manifesto of 2014 and 2019 general elections, the former MP said the saffron party did not act on it. \"At least now you (BJP) should act upon it and make sure the Women's Reservation Bill is tabled in this Parliament session or the next one,\" she urged.Taking at dig at the Prime Minister, she said Narendra Modi speaks about \"Nari Shakti\" from the Red Fort, but does nothing for women's empowerment, which the country has now realised.Given the majority that the BJP enjoys in the Parliament, if they could pass the three Farm laws (the controversial agriculture reform laws which were subsequently withdrawn), they can certainly push for and pass the Women's Reservation Bill if they are willing to do the same, Kavitha pointed out. \"It is easy for them. But they are not willing to do. They do not want women to come forward. That is the message we are getting from Narendra Modiji.\" On the vision of the BRS on the issue of the Women's Reservation Bill, she said the BRS party, under the leadership of Chief Minister KCR passed a resolution in the Telangana Assembly, which stated that whenever Lok Sabha passes the bill, the BRS will support it.The CM also proposed an alternative solution wherein he suggested an increase in the number of MP seats by 33 per cent to accommodate women to address the insecurities of leaders and parties and paving way for the soft passing of the Women's Reservation Bill, she recalled.Kavitha castigated the BJP led Centre on matters of governance and said when anybody reminds the saffron party of its 'failures,' suddenly all the institutions are activated against that voice but why are they silent on Adani issues despite several reports.\"Were LPG rates increased to divert attention from Adani's issue?\" she asked.\"Curbing information flow, freedom, and freedom of expression is the sad reality of India under the BJP today. Across the nation there is an opinion today that there is an undeclared emergency in this country\" she alleged, reacting to a query.She reiterated that BRS has always been demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate Adani group issue.Kavitha hailed the Supreme Court ruling on the appointment of election commissioners.\"I believe that the Election Commission has been freed from the clutches of BJP and Narendra Modi. A strong message was going that it was not functioning independently looking at various instances. I hope the court's order will be adhered to,\" she said.The BRS leader asked the Congress party to shed its \"arrogance\" and then talk about election strategy with everybody (other political parties) if it was keen on ousting the BJP from power in 2024.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"We are keen and we are talking to all political parties and are committed to oust the BJP in 2024.

In Hinduism, the belief is that the cow is the representative of divine and natural beneficence. Therefore it should be protected and venerated,\" Justice Shamim Ahmad said on February 14, dismissing a plea seeking the quashing of criminal proceedings against a person under the Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955.The petitioner, Barabanki resident Mohammad Abdul Khaliq, had pleaded that the police charged him without any evidence and hence the proceedings pending against him in the court of additional chief judicial magistrate should be quashed. Dismissing the plea, the bench held that from the facts on record, a prima- facie case was made out against the petitioner.While passing the order, the judge observed, \"The cow has also been associated with various deities, notably Lord Shiva (whose steed is Nandi, a bull) Lord Indra (closely associated with Kamadhenu), Lord Krishna (a cowherd in his youth), and goddesses in general.\"\"According to legend, she emerged from the ocean of milk at the time of Samudramanthan (the great churning of the ocean by the gods and demons). She was presented to the seven sages and with time came into the custody of sage Vasishta.\"The judge further said that a cow's legs symbolise the four Vedas and her milk is four \"purushartha\" (or human objectives -- \"dharma\" or righteousness, \"artha\" or material wealth, \"kama\" or desire and \"moksha\" or salvation.\"Her horns symbolise the gods, her face the sun and moon, and her shoulders \"Agni\" (the god of fire). The cow has also been described in other forms: Nanda, Sunanda, Surabhi, Susheela and Sumana,\" Justice Ahmad said.He said that the origin of the veneration of the cow can be traced to the Vedic period.\"The Indo-European peoples who entered India in the second millennium BCE were pastoralists. Cattle had a major economic significance that was reflected in their religion. The slaughter of milk-producing cows was increasingly prohibited. It is forbidden in the Mahabharata, and in the 'Manusmriti'\".A cow which produces milk was said to be \"unslayable\" in the Rigveda, the court said, adding, \"The degree of veneration afforded to cow is indicated by the use in rites of healing purification and penance of the \"panchagavya\" (cow-milk, curd, butter, urine, and dung).\" Subsequently, with the rise of the ideal of \"ahimsa\", cow came to symbolise non-violence, it said.\"In addition, because her products supplied nourishment, the cow was associated with motherhood and Mother Earth and legislation against cow killing persisted into the 20th century in many princely states,\" said the court.According to the high court bench, legends also state that Brahma gave life to priests and cows at the same time so that the priests could recite religious scriptures while cows could afford ghee as an offering in rituals.\"Anyone who kills cows or allows others to kill them is deemed to rot in hell for as many years as there are hairs upon his body. Likewise, the bull is depicted as a vehicle of Lord Shiva: a symbol of respect for the male cattle.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"In the Mahabharata, Bhishma observes that the cow acts as a surrogate mother by providing milk to human beings for a lifetime, so she is truly the mother of the world.

Lord Rama was given a gift of many cows,\" the bench said.Dismissing the petition, it said, \"This Lucknow bench hopes and trusts that the Central Government will take appropriate decision to ban cow slaughter in the country and declare cows 'protected national animal'.\"",

Each hallmarked article has a unique HUID number which is traceable.Till now, the old hallmarked jewellery with four marks without HUID was also permitted to be sold by the jewellers along with the six-digit HUID mark.

        "text": "India truly is the \"mother of democracy\", Kiren Rijuju (File)Bhubaneshwar:Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday said attempts were being made to tell the world that the Indian judiciary and the democracy were in crisis.Inaugurating a conference of the Centre's counsels in the Eastern states, Mr Rijiju said the wisdom of judges was beyond public scrutiny.\"Indian judiciary cannot be questioned, especially the wisdom of judges cannot be put into public scrutiny,\" he said.\"At times, calibrated attempts are being made from both inside and outside the country to tell the world that the Indian judiciary is in crisis. A message is being sent to the world that Indian democracy is in crisis. It is a deliberate attempt by some groups to malign the image of the country,\" he added.No campaign with ulterior motives can succeed in defaming India and its democratic setup, Mr Rijiju said.The US may stake claim to be the oldest democracy, but India truly is the \"mother of democracy\", he said.Mr Rijiju's comments came after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at a lecture at Cambridge University alleged that Indian democracy is under attack and several politicians, including himself, are under surveillance.Rahul Gandhi listed five key aspects of the alleged attack on Indian democracy - capture and control of media and judiciary; surveillance and intimidation; coercion by federal law enforcement agencies; attacks on minorities, Dalits and tribals; and shutting down of dissent.Noting that it was unfortunate that judges were being abused on social media, Mr Rijiju said this was happening as some people were not aware of how the Indian judiciary functions.\"It is not a good sign when the judiciary is subjected to some kind of criticism. The judiciary must be far away from public criticism,\" he said, adding that the problem lies with the same group, which wants to force the judiciary to play the role of the opposition party.\"The Indian judiciary will never accept it. I am sure the judiciary will resist the forceful attempt to make it play the role of opposition. This cannot happen,\" he said.The minister maintained it is because of the Constitution that the government is of the view that the appointment of judges cannot be done by judicial orders.The opinion of the executive and the judiciary may differ at times as everybody cannot have the same observation, he said.Mr Rijiju said 65 redundant laws have been proposed to be repealed in the next session of Parliament. So far, 1,486 redundant laws have been removed.He said the government wants to make India safe and secure, and so, it has to make stringent laws.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOn the demand for a permanent bench of the high court in western Odisha, he said the Centre was ready to give its approval if the state government submits a complete proposal.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

He talks anti-India by going to foreign embassies. It is a new agenda of the Congress to defame India in foreign countries.\"Criticising the country abroad is an anti-national step. Therefore, the country and the people will never forgive Rahul Gandhi, he added.Rahul Gandhi, recently in a lecture at Cambridge University, claimed that his phone was being spied on through Pegasus, an Israeli spyware, and that he was warned by intelligence officers to be 'careful' about what he speaks on calls.\"I had Pegasus on my phone. A large number of politicians had Pegasus on their phones. I have been called by intelligence officers who told me, 'Please be careful about what you are saying on the phone because we are sort of recording the stuff'. So this is the constant pressure that we feel. Cases on the opposition. I have got a number of criminal liable cases for things that should under no circumstances be criminal liable cases. That's what we are trying to defend,\" the Congress leader said in his address.Chief Minister Chouhan further slammed former Chief Minister Kamal Nath over raising questions on Mukhyamantri Ladli Behna Yojana.Mr Chouhan said, \"I am asking very responsibly today and Nath has to answer. I asked earlier as well but did not get an answer. In 2017, we started depositing Rs 1,000 in the bank accounts of women belonging to Baiga, Bharia and Sahariya tribes. So that their children in the family can be nurtured properly.\"\"We deposited Rs 1,000 in the accounts of the women till our government remained in power in the state which was till 2018. As soon as the Congress government came to power, why did you (Nath) stop depositing Rs 1,000 to the accounts of Baiga, Bharia, Sahariya sisters? Today these women are asking you a question,\" he added.Besides, the chief minister said, \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that Indore is an era that goes ahead of time. Indore has made another innovation, we had seen ambulances for humans, ambulances for animals, but now tree ambulances have been started in Indore for taking care of trees.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIf any plant gets sick in the gardens or on the roadsides, then this ambulance will take care of the plants in the city.

First, they took out a desk from the school. Brought it outside and climbed on it and started putting a poster of 'I love Manish Sisodia' on the gate, to which people objected and said that this is a temple of education, keep it away from politics.\"\"We even asked them if they had permission. They claimed to be related to MLA Abdul Rehman. After this, a person contacted the MLA and asked him if he had given permission and the MLA replied with a yes. We know the MLA is lying as such permission is never given for a school to be used for some political gains.\" Pandey added.The complainant stated that the banner was removed after the people protested.He said, \"The problem is that children were made to write 'I love Manish Sisodia'. Our culture does not allow all these things.\"\"They are trying to brainwash the children. We asked the principal, but he failed to recognize the seriousness of the matter, after which I lodged a complaint. The police have registered a case taking cognizance and assured that the culprits will be punished,\" he added.While talking toANI, a local resident Durgesh Tiwari said, \"Some AAP workers had come here and put the 'I Love Sisodia' banner on the gate and called the children who were coming to school to sit near the gate.\"\"I confronted them and said what they were doing was not right.

They said that the children are registering their sympathy towards him,\" Tiwari added.Expressing displeasure over the incident, Tiwari said, \"Children are defending alcohol accused, how far is that right? These people are forcing the child and the principal of the school to get such activities done. In the same school, religious activity was conducted by these representatives. However, no action was taken.\"Mr Sisodia was arrested by the CBI on Sunday last for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of Delhi's new excise policy. The policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the Opposition.Manish Sisodia had on Friday filed a bail plea in Rouse Avenue Court after the SC refused to intervene in the matter.The fresh bail petition filed on behalf of Mr Sisodia before a trial court in the national capital stated that no fruitful purpose would be served by keeping him (Sisodia) in custody as all the recoveries in the case have already been made.It stated further that the former Delhi deputy CM was cooperating in the investigation and had appeared whenever summoned by the CBI.

In cases of rape, conviction was achieved in 671 cases in 2022 as compared to 177 in 2020. Likewise, 2,313 cases under the POCSO Act saw conviction as compared to 535 in 2020.In cases of dowry death, kidnapping and sexual harassment, the conviction rate has gone up by 220 per cent, 475 per cent and 2,075 per cent, respectively, in the last two years.The efforts have also materialised into speedy trials.Last year, 34 POCSO cases saw the accused being convicted within a month of filing of the charge sheet. In 2021, the number was just seven and the year before that, it was just five.\"The e-Prosecution portal comes into play once police file a charge sheet in a case. Once the details of the case are uploaded, sending summons to production of witnesses is monitored through the platform,\" said Additional Director General of Police (Prosecution) Ashutosh Pandey.The online monitoring of cases not only helps in better coordination with all related parties, including police, courts and advocates, but also helps in tracking which stage the case is in.\"We have tried to bring together every party related to prosecution to ensure that justice is delivered in time. The e-Prosecution portal plays a key role in ensuring this,\" the officer added.Considering the varied nature of crime and the sheer volume of cases lodged across the state, the prosecution department has put special focus on cases related to crime against women, the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act along with cases lodged against dreaded criminals, Pandey said.\"We have tried to change the attitude of government prosecutors, police and judicial officers so that they could work in tandem for a speedy trial,\" said Pandey.Senior advocate Rohit Kant said the conviction rates in crime against women and children in Uttar Pradesh have improved remarkably.\"The duration of the trial in these cases has also reduced which signals a change in the mindset of people involved in the prosecution,\" he said.Even in cases related to mafia, the conviction rate has gone up. Between March and December 2022, a total of 16 mafia were convicted in 23 cases, the data showed.\"Many of these cases were almost 10 to 20 years old and yet the trial had not started because of various delay tactics adopted by the mafia. In some of these cases, they were even acquitted by lower courts. Yet we ensured conviction in the High Court,\" Pandey said.To bring about the change, government prosecutors were given laptops and trained to upload case details on the portal, the officer said.The department also sought help from the office of the Director General of Police, Principal Secretary (Law), Principal Secretary (Home) and Registrar of Allahabad High Court to communicate with officials of their departments at the district level across the state.\"We also introduced state and district-level monthly ranking for our prosecutors to motivate them,\" informed Pandey.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe officer even decided to send the trophy presented by the Union Home ministry to Uttar Pradesh for claiming the top spot in the number of disposals and entry of cases through the e-Prosecution portal to every district in 2021 as part of a team-building exercise.\"The trophy for 2022 that we got recently will also be sent to the districts to instil a sense of pride in our prosecutors and police officials for their hard work in ensuring conviction in cases,\" said the officer.",

A few days ago, shoals of the prized fish were spotted in the river in Mirzapur.Sandeep Behera, an advisor to the Union Jal Shakti ministry's National Mission for Clean Ganga, toldPTI, \"The fact that the Hilsa has reached Mirzapur is an indication that the Ganga is gradually getting cleaned.\"Oxygen levels have also risen because the Hilsa moves very fast and it requires a lot of oxygen.\" Mr Behera, who was here to attend a seminar by Nehru Gram Bharati (Deemed) University and ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute, Barrackpore, said a fish ladder on the barrage allowed the Hilsa to move upstream earlier.However, the ladder gate has been non-functional for years. Now, the gate is being changed so that the fish can swim upstream in the Hooghly river, Mr Behera said.A fish ladder is a pass along the divider wall of a barrage to enable the migration of fishes.Often described as the 'queen of fish', Hilsa is liked for its taste and smell. It can be savoured when fried or cooked in mustard sauce.Although it is a tropical saltwater fish, it thrives in rivers and estuaries.Mr Behera said that while Hilsa is a marine fish, it lays eggs in freshwater. However, following the barrage's construction in 1971-72, it could not move upstream to lay eggs.The tender for the fish ladder has been floated and it will be finalised in six to seven months. It is possible that the ladder will be replaced by the end of this year, he said.A very popular variety of fish in West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Odisha, Hilsa prices range from Rs 1,200 to Rs 3,000 per kg.Hilsa, considered a nonpareil delicacy when fried, smoked or cooked in mustard sauce, typically travels up the Ganga, Brahmaputra and Irrawaddy from the Bay of Bengal during the rainy season to spawn.The fish is also found in the Arabian Sea from where it swims upstream through rivers in Gujarat and Pakistan's Sindhu, as well as in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Vietnam and China seas.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe peak upstream migration of the fish coincides with the advent of monsoon in July and August and continues up to October and November, according to a 2017 report by the Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Both Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi were questioned by the ED last year.Meanwhile, the AAP slammed the Congress and said, \"Congress disappears when national issues are raised\".\"Congress has never stood with the opposition, this has been its history. We have been hearing the BJP's claim that they will put Rahul Gandhi and Robert Vadra in jail. This is just a war of words. Congress disappears when national issues are raised,\" said AAP's spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.The opposition leaders cited the example of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was under the scanner of the CBI and the ED in 2014 and 2015 over the Saradha chit fund scam when he was with the Congress.Others who have signed the letter are National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Sena's Uddav Thackeray, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav.\"We hope you would agree that India is still a democratic country.

Be it Lalu Prasad Yadav (Rashtriya Janata Dal), Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena), Azam Khan (Samajwadi Party), Nawab Malik, Anil Deshmukh (NCP), Abhishek Banerjee (TMC), central agencies have often sparked suspicion that they were working as extended wings of the ruling dispensation at the centre. In many such cases, the timings of the cases lodged or arrests made have coincided with elections making it abundantly clear that they were politically motivated,\" the opposition leaders said in the letter.Mr Sisodia was arrested for alleged corruption in framing a liquor policy for Delhi. The BJP has rubbished the AAP's political vendetta argument, saying even if he was the Education Minister who may have done some work for improving schools, he cannot use that as a curtain behind which he could indulge in corruption.\"It is regrettable that even after Sisodia's arrest, the Delhi government is not stopping its dirty politics in the name of education and has now stooped as low as to involving innocent school kids in it,\" Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said on Friday, referring to an alleged plan to set up \"I Love Manish Sisodia\" desks in Delhi government schools to gather support for their arrested leader, which the AAP has said is a fake news cooked up by the BJP to tarnish the image of Delhi's ruling party.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe central agencies have over the years maintained they do not arrest people over false charges and only leave them if they are not found guilty after a thorough investigation, irrespective of their political background.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a press release)",

        "text": "Sheezan Khan was arrested in Tunisha Sharma's death case.Palghar:A court in Vasai in Maharashtra's Palghar district that gave bail to actor Sheezan Khan in the Tunisha Sharma suicide case has said there was no need to keep him in jail since the probe was complete and chargesheet filed.In his order of Saturday, details of which were made available on Sunday, Additional Sessions Judge RD Deshpande said Mr Khan's presence for the hearings can be ensured through certain bail conditions as well as obtaining heavy surety from him.Ms Sharma allegedly died by suicide by hanging herself on December 24, 2022, on the sets of a TV serial near Valiv in Palghar. Mr Khan (28) was arrested the next day for abetment of suicide on a complaint lodged by Ms Sharma's mother.\"After completion of investigation and filing of chargesheet, I do not find any special circumstances to keep this applicant (Khan) behind the bars. The say filed by the prosecution nowhere contemplates any sufficient grounds for which the applicant is to be detained behind bars,\" the judge said in the order.In his submission to court, Mr Khan's counsel Shailendra Mishra said even if it was assumed his client withdrew from the relationship with the dead, refusal on his part to restore this relationship would not go on to satisfy ingredients of abetment.The relationship had broken two months prior to the incident and the applicant's role in taking the victim to hospital showed his innocence in the case, Mr Mishra further told court.Mr Khan is a well known actor and has a permanent place of residence in Mumbai and, therefore, would attend court dates diligently and regularly, he said, adding further jail time for him would mean pre-trial conviction.In his bail order, Judge Deshpande said, \"However, now investigation is complete and police have filed chargesheet in the Judicial Magistrate First Class Vasai. It is important to note even after filing of the charge sheet the police machinery is not able to bring on record as to what really happened between both of them in those last ten minutes.\"It has been argued by the prosecution the mobile phone of Ms Sharma was not \"opening\" for collection of data, but that aspect is to be dealt with by the prosecution and the (forensic science) laboratory officials, the judge said.The judge also cited congestion in jails as one of the reasons for granting bail, adding the prosecution could approach court if Mr Khan violates any of the conditions laid down upon him.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)HelplinesVandrevala Foundation for Mental Health9999666555orhelp@vandrevalafoundation.comTISS iCall022-25521111(Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)",

        "title": "BJP Falls Back On BS Yediyurappa, Makes Him \"Mascot\" For Assembly Polls",
        "text": "BS Yediyurappa is a big mass leader in KarnatakaBengaluru:The BJP seems to be falling back on its seasoned oarsman BS Yediyurappa making him a key poll mascot, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as it shores up campaign in poll-bound Karnataka.The octogenarian, who has already announced his retirement from electoral politics, is sought to be put on the pedestal by the governing party's central leaders.The reasons are not far to seek as to why Mr Yediyurappa has been pushed to the top of the campaign plank, the four-time Chief Minister, who built the party from grassroots level, has a mass appeal and connect -- particularly the politically influential Lingayat community -- that no other party leader in the State commands.It's now quite evident from the BJP's campaign narrative that the party is banking on the \"Yediyurappa factor\" and putting him up as the \"poster boy\" by leveraging his clout to the hilt.The BJP central leadership -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, party President J P Nadda and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh -- have been lavish in their praise of Mr Yediyurappa, during their public meetings in the State in recent days.It's not often that in PM's programme, someone else hogs the limelight, but on one such occasion on February 27, at a public meeting in Shivamogga, it appeared that Modi himself was giving the Karnataka BJP strongman a pride of place in his \"Karma Bhoomi\".The recent public meeting marking the inauguration of the Shivamogga airport, coinciding with Yediyurappa's 80th birthday, saw Modi terming his contributions to public life 'inspirational.' The PM felicitated him on stage as he made an appeal to the people attending the public meeting to flash their mobile phone lights in a gesture of honour to Yediyurappa and there was an enthusiastic response from the large gathering.Then, as the Lingayat strongman concluded his speech, Modi stood up and applauded him. The PM has also made it a point repeatedly to highlight the last speech delivered by Yediyurappa in the Karnataka assembly recently, and said it was an inspiration to every person in public life.Amit Shah too at a public meeting recently had urged the people to repose faith in PM Modi and Mr Yediyurappa and vote the BJP back to power in the State.Similar comments have been made by Nadda and Rajnath Singh, who were recently in the state for campaigning.According to some political observers and BJP insiders, the party's move to project Yediyurappa seems to be aimed at blunting anti-incumbency, keeping the Lingayat vote-base intact and countering the opposition Congress, which has levelled allegations of corruption against the government.Political analyst A Narayana from the Azim Premji University, said the BJP was initially preparing to face elections without Yediyurappa in an active role but \"as there was not much for the party to count on locally, it was inevitable for them to repackage and present him\".That's the reason they are going out of their way to prove that they have not offended him by asking to resign as Chief Minister in 2021, he said.\"They (BJP) tried their best to secure Lingayat support without Yediyurappa, but they are not very confident about it, that's the reason they are doing it. They could have afforded to lose some Lingayat support, provided they were confident about cultivating support from some other communities, which also they don't seem to be very confident about ,\" Narayana said.Yediyurappa resigned as CM on July 26, 2021. Age was seen as a primary factor for his exit from the top job, with an unwritten rule in the BJP of keeping out those above 75 years from elected offices. Also, the BJP central leadership wanted to make way for new leadership ahead of the Assembly polls.Unlike the 2018 poll campaign, when Yediyurappa was the CM candidate and face of the party, the BJP this time has opted for a collective approach, though it initially tried to project Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai's leadership.Narayana said: \"BJP tried to win over Lingayats through Bommai, but they don't seem to be confident about having achieved that, with all the discontent brewing on issues such as reservation. \" \"Also as long as Yediyurappa is there and as long as he is an unhappy man, it is not possible for another Lingayat leader to cultivate Lingayat support\", he said, adding that this is quite obviously one of the reasons why BJP wants to keep Yediyrappa in good spirits.With the party now putting Mr Yediyurappa in the forefront of campaign, Mr Bommai's stake seems to have weakened, according to poll observers and some within the BJP, even as a section within the party credits him for pro-people schemes, reservation hike for SC/ST and for presenting an all inclusive budget.According to another party functionary, retaining Lingayat vote base, despite BS Yediyurappa not being its CM face, is crucial for the BJP to win the election with absolute majority, and that's the reason why the party wants to assure the dominant community, that he is still relevant to it.He also pointed to disgruntlement among a section of Lingayat community, especially the 'Panchamasali Lingayats' on the issue of reservation, and said it may pose a threat, and it needs to be mitigated immediately.\"It has to be communicated effectively that along with being the BJP's top Parliamentary Board member, Yediyurappa is still the party's face or mascot in Karnataka,\" he said.BJP state General Secretary N Ravi Kumar said Mr Yediyurappa is a big mass leader in Karnataka and he is someone who built and nurtured the party in the state.\"He is a four time CM and two time Leader of Opposition, he knows nook and corner of the state, he is leader of all communities including Lingayats, and people from all sections respect him. He is naturally projected as one of the faces, what is wrong?\" Ravi Kumar asked.\"There may be some amount of anti-incumbency, I'm not totally rejecting it, all governments will have it, but Bommai has given a good budget and has given good programmes....it is the creation of Congress, why didn't they speak positively about Yediyurappa so far and are doing it now? it is because Congress' strategy is to attract positive public opinion about Yediyurappa in their favour,\" he said.Mr Yediyurappa too on his part had recently appealed to the dominant Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, to which he belongs, to continue their support to the ruling BJP in the upcoming Assembly polls, and ensure its victory in the State.This statement has come amid attempts by opposition Congress and JD(S) to project that Yediyurappa is being sidelined by the BJP, as they sought to woo the numerically and politically dominant community.Veerashaiva-Lingayats are estimated to form about 17 per cent of the State's population, and they form the BJP's strong vote base. Yediyurappa is considered to be the tallest Veerashaiva-Lingayat leader and continues to hold sway over the community.It appears that the former CM, in return, is seeking to secure the political future of his sons.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comWhile announcing that he will not contest assembly polls, Yediyurappa in the same breath had said that he will be vacating his Shikaripura Assembly seat, from where his younger son and the party's state Vice-President B Y Vijayendra will be contesting, if the high command agrees.Mr Yediyurappa, soon after stepping down as CM in 2021, wanted to make Vijayendra Minister, through the MLC route, but was not successful in his attempts. His elder son, B Y Raghavendra is Member of Parliament from Shivamogga.",

As a common man, I give you 24 hours, to touch me if possible,\" the BJP state unit president said in a tweet.The fresh remarks by the BJP leader came after the state's Cyber Crime Division charged him under sections of inciting violence and promoting enmity between groups among others.I understand DMK has filed cases against me for exposing their 7-decade propaganda against North Indian brothers.So, here is the video of what they spoke, which was mentioned in my press release yesterday.I challenge Fascist DMK to arrest me!pic.twitter.com/U3ZwbXmSSG- K.Annamalai (@annamalai_k)March 5, 2023The police's action came just a day after he held the state government responsible for the ongoing stir regarding migrant labourers in the southern state.Taking to Twitter, Mr Annamalai also said that the police's response [of filing cases against him] came after he exposed \"DMK's seven-decade propaganda against the north Indian people\".\"I understand DMK has filed cases against me for exposing their 7-decade propaganda against North Indian brothers. So, here is the video of what they spoke, which was mentioned in my press release yesterday. I challenge Fascist DMK to arrest me!,\" Mr Annamalai said.The BJP leader yesterday released a statement on the migrant labourers' issue saying they are safe in Tamil Nadu but the Chief Minister Stalin led-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and its alliance party leaders are the reason for the hate against them.He also opposed the spread of false news on the attack on the people from Bihar in the state, saying that Tamils don't support \"separatism\" and \"vile hatred\" against north Indians.\"It is disheartening to see fake news spread in social media about attacks on Migrant workers in Tamil Nadu. We, the Tamil people, believe in the concept of \"The World is One\" and do not endorse the separatism and vile hatred against our North Indian friends,\" Mr Annamalai said in a series of tweets.Hitting out at the state government, he said, \"DMK's MPs' vile comments on North Indians, DMK minister calling them Panipuri Wala, and their alliance partners demanding their exodus has triggered what we see today.\"He further said that the people, the Government and the police, do not endorse the views of DMK and their alliance partners.Besides, K Annamalai, the Tamil Nadu police have also registered against the holder of 'BJP Bihar' Twitter account holder under sections 153, 153A(1)(a), 505(1)(b) IPC 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)As reported earlier, four persons including a BJP spokesperson Prashant Umrao and two journalists have also been booked on the charges of spreading false news over alleged attack on migrant workers in the state.Prashant Umrao, an Editor with Dainik Bhaskar, a Patna-based journalist, owner of 'Tanvir Post' Twitter handle Mohammad Tanvir, and Shubam Shukla were booked at different police stations on the charges of spreading \"false\" news regarding attacks on migrant labourers in Tamil Nadu.A statewide panic was created among migrant workers, working in Tamil Nadu, after several purported videos, showing attacks on migrant workers, circulated on social media.The panic was triggered after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday, raised concerns and took note of the purported videos of \"attacks\".The panic affected the industries in Tamil Nadu, which rely on migrant workers, badly as many workers stayed off work.Taking cognizance of the panic, Tamil Nadu's Director General of Police Sylendra Babu released a statement, saying that the video doing rounds of social media was \"false\" and \"mischievous\".PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Somebody in Bihar posted false and mischievous videos saying that migrant workers were attacked in Tamil Nadu. Two videos were posted. Both are false as these incidents happened at an earlier date in Tiruppur and Coimbatore. One was a clash between two groups of migrant workers from Bihar while another was from a clash between two local residents in Coimbatore,\" the top cop said.The DGP also said that the persons behind this rumour-driven panic will not be spared.",

        "text": "The Jat gathering will be keenly watched by the BJP and the CongressJaipur:As Rajasthan gears up for election later this year, a Jat gathering in Jaipur today points to a shift in poll arithmetic that may throw up new challenges for both the Congress and BJP.The 'mahakumbh' is being seen as a show of strength by the community in the run-up to the Assembly polls, but the absence of some prominent names from the list of attendees hints at a potential split in Jat votes.How Important Is Jat VoteJats are an influential caste group in Rajasthan's political landscape and can play a decisive impact on poll results. The community traditionally voted for the Congress since Independence. But in 1999, when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government provided them reservation under the OBC category, they changed their allegiance en masse to the BJP.Over the next two decades, they largely backed the BJP. But in the run-up to the 2018 state polls, murmurs of resentment grew loud as Jat leaders complained that the community did not get its due. They also raised the demand for a Jat Chief Minister. Then Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje did try to salvage the BJP's prospects, positioning herself as 'Jat Ki Bahu', but results showed it did not work.Out of the 30 seats where Jats are known to wield influence, the Congress won 18, powering Ashok Gehlot's journey to power.What Has Changed NowThe years leading to the 2018 state polls also saw the rise of Hanuman Beniwal, a former BJP leader who formed his own outfit. He subsequently tied up with the BJP. In 2020, when the farmers' protest against the now-repealed agriculture laws gathered steam, the Jat leader walked out of the NDA, saying no alliance was more important than farmers' interests.Interestingly, Mr Beniwal is not part of the Jat mahakumbh in Jaipur, indicating a potential split in the community's votes.This emerging poll arithmetic will be keenly watched by the BJP and the Congress as they fine-tune their campaign for the upcoming polls.Challenge For CongressThe Congress already faces the tall challenge of putting up a united front amid the ongoing tussle between Chief Minister Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot. Mr Pilot, who led the 2020 rebellion that almost toppled the Congress government, is from the Gurjar community -- another influential caste group. He is now touring Jat-dominated areas to rally support for the Congress. While the Congress is projecting the rallies as political outreach, a Jat support base may also provide more political muscle to Mr Pilot within the organisation. Mr Gehlot, who has earlier said that caste cannot determine who gets the Chief Minister post, is also reaching out to the community as the elections approach.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comBJP's GameplanFor the BJP too, the road is far from smooth. The party faces the challenge of containing the power tussle between former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Ms Raje's supporters have already turned her birthday celebrations into a show of strength. The BJP veteran comes from Dhaulpur -- one of the two Jat strongholds in Rajasthan. A consolidation of Jat votes will be critical in the BJP's push for power. A potential split in the community's votes will require the BJP to reach out to individual leaders, including Mr Beniwal who has severed ties with the NDA. The party has already started attempts to tap into Gurjars' resentment for Mr Pilot not getting the Chief Minister post.",

Dismissing the plea, the bench held that from the facts on record, a prima- facie case was made out against the petitioner.While passing the order, the judge observed, \"The cow has also been associated with various deities, notably Lord Shiva (whose steed is Nandi, a bull) Lord Indra (closely associated with Kamadhenu), Lord Krishna (a cowherd in his youth), and goddesses in general.\"The bench also noted that as per the legends, cows emerged from the ocean of milk at the time of Samudramanthan or the great churning of the ocean by the gods and demons and that she was presented to the seven sages, and in the course of time came into the custody of sage, Vasishta.The judge further said that a cow's legs symbolise the four Vedas and her milk is four \"Purushartha\" (or human objectives -- \"dharma\" or righteousness, \"artha\" or material wealth, \"kama\" or desire and \"moksha\" or salvation.\"Her horns symbolise the gods, her face the sun and moon, and her shoulders \"Agni\" (the god of fire).

Without conducting a proper inquiry into it, he tried to shut the case, if Lokayukta was there then cases would have been registered against them, but it was shut then. The Siddaramaiah led government tried to protect the corruption and has closed the cases, whereas the BJP administration has given all powers to Lokayukta to take action against whoever have committed the mistake, even if the person is from our own party.\"\"This is our morality, while theirs (Congress) was to close cases, so we need not learn lessons from them.\" Further, hitting out at Congress for protesting on the issue, Mr Bommai said, people are aware of their truth, and they are doing it for the sake of politics.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Corruption, loot, murders, extortions that took place during Congress rule, 59 cases have been referred to Lokayukta, they will be inquired into and the truth will come out,\" he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The scheme aims to provide financial support to women who are married and have children but do not have any formal employment.14,000 beneficiaries from nearly 32 constituencies in Sikkim, which includes married women who are 18-years-old and above, who do not work outside the house, and whose family members do not hold any regular government jobs have been covered under the scheme.The scheme promises a sum of Rs 20,000 annually and covers all the mothers in the state who are non-working, single or divorced, victims of child sexual abuse, unwed mothers, and widowed mothers in a bid to promote self-reliance and autonomy among women.The scheme has been named 'Aama Sasaktikaran Yojana' and Chief Minister PS Tamang gave cheques to 14,000 beneficiaries at Rangpo, East Sikkim.\"For 2023, we have allocated Rs 100 crore to finance the scheme and the main aim is to empower mothers financially in the household. The money, which is a sum of Rs 20,000 will go into their accounts and this will allow them to spend the money as per their requirements,\" the Chief Minister told reporters.Furthermore, the Chief Minister said that mothers who are also homemakers are ignored in society and the Sikkim government is thus \"focusing on the potential for these uncelebrated heroes in the family\".The Sikkim government claims it is the first state in the country to initiate a welfare scheme with such unique qualities which will not only ensure the sustainability of the mothers in the society but will also give them the capability to change the lives of their families.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"It will also give women an opportunity to utilize the funds towards supporting educational requirements of their children, augment family income and other necessities,\" the state government claimed.Through this programme the state government says it will foster the practice of saving money among non-working mothers who are currently residing in the state.",

        "text": "Rahul Gandhi said that S Jaishankar \"does not understand the China threat.\" (File)New Delhi:Attacking the NDA government at the Centre, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar \"does not understand the China threat,\" adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that \"nobody has entered Indian territory\" is an invitation to the Chinese that they can do it again.In a conversation with members of the Indian Journalists' Association in London, the Wayanad MP also said that he supports Indian foreign policy and doesn't have a huge disagreement with it with regard to India's position on the Russia-Ukraine war.\"As far as Indian foreign policy is concerned, I support the Indian foreign policy and I am okay with it. I don't have a huge disagreement with it,\" he said when asked a hypothetical question that if China or Pakistan invaded India and since India hadn't taken a position on the Russia-Ukraine war, it could also be ignored by the World if an invasion into India happened.Mr Gandhi said, \"With regards to an invasion, we have already been invaded. We have got 2000 square km of our territory that is in the hands of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the Prime Minister himself has stated that nobody has entered India, not a single inch of land has been taken and this destroyed our negotiation position because our negotiators are being asked what's the fuss about.\"\"Your Prime Minister says that no land has been taken. So that's one aspect of it. The other aspect which I keep saying is India needs to be very, very careful with what the Chinese are doing at the border. The Chinese are acting in a hostile manner, in an aggressive manner and we need to be very very careful and I have been stating that again and again, I don't think the penny has dropped in the government. I think there is a risk as you say,\" added Rahul Gandhi.Speaking about Congress's China policy, Rahul Gandhi said that Congress's policy was that they would not allow anyone to enter Indian territory.\"The Congress party's policy on China is very clear, we do not accept anybody entering our territory and pushing us around and bullying us. It doesn't matter who they are, that's not acceptable to us and what has happened is that the Chinese entered our territory, killed our soldiers and the prime minister has denied it,\" he said.\"That's the problem. The idea, we have a relationship with the United States and we have a partnership with them and we have a shred democratic free idea. I think there is a coercive idea on a planet and there is a democratic idea on a planet and I think a democratic planet needs to be strengthened. But you will not strengthen the democratic idea unless you start to fundamentally think about things like production. The huge amount of inequality that is erupting in the West and India is a threat to the democratic idea. We have to think about that. We have to have a strategy for that and that's not on the table,\" he added.When asked about how India should deal with military threats, the Congress leader said, \"You have to deal with military threats militarily. But you have to understand the nature of the threat and you have to respond to the nature of the threat. I had one conversation with the Foreign Minister in my view he doesn't understand the threat. The government is not understanding the actual threat from China. The Prime Minister stating that nobody has entered our territory demonstrates that he does not understand the threat because the message to China with that statement is you can do it again,\" added Rahul Gandhi in an interaction at the Indian Journalists Association in London.Earlier, hitting out at Rahul Gandhi who has been targeting the government over China's aggression on the LAC in eastern Ladakh, S Jaishankar said that it is not the Congress leader but Prime Minister Narendra Modi who sent the Army to the Line of Actual Control as a countermeasure to troop deployment by China and the opposition party should have honesty to look at what happened in 1962.\"When did that area actually come under Chinese control? They (Congress) must have some problem understanding words beginning with 'C'. I think they are deliberately misrepresenting the situation. The Chinese first came there in 1958 and the Chinese captured it in October 1962. Now you are going to blame the Modi government in 2023 for a bridge which the Chinese captured in 1962 and you don't have the honesty to say that it is where it happened,\" said Dr Jaishankar in an interview to ANI.\"Rajiv Gandhi went to Beijing in 1988...signed agreements in 1993 and 1996. I do not think signing those agreements was wrong. This is not a political point I am making. I think those agreements were signed at that time because we needed to stabilise the border. And they did, stabilise the border,\" said S Jaishankar.When asked that Rahul Gandhi thought S Jaishankar was insufficient. Jaishankar said that he was always open to listen. \"I think he said this somewhere in a public meeting. It is probably in the context of China. All I can say in my defence is I have been the longest-serving ambassador in China. I have been dealing with a lot of these border issues for a very long time. I am not suggesting that I am necessarily the most knowledgeable person, but I would have a fairly good self-opinion of my understanding of what is up there. If he has superior knowledge and wisdom on China, I am always willing to listen. As I said, for me life is a learning process. If that is a possibility, I have never closed my mind to anything however improbable that may be,\" said Jaishankar.The External Affairs Minister stressed that when other countries' demands are not reasonable, the government will not be able to come to an agreement.Asked about the Congress party's allegation that the Modi government is defensive and reactive on the China issue, S Jaishankar dismissed the claims saying there is currently the largest peacetime deployment along the China border.\"If I would have to sum up this China thing, please do not buy this narrative that somewhere the government is on the defensive...somewhere we are being accommodative. I ask people if we were being accommodative who sent the Indian Army to the LAC (Line of Actual Control). Rahul Gandhi did not send them. Narendra Modi sent them. We have today the largest peacetime deployment in our history on the China border. We are keeping troops there at a huge cost with great effort. We have increased our infrastructure spending on the border five times in this government. Now tell me who is the defensive and accommodative person? Who is actually telling the truth? Who is depicting things accurately? Who is playing footsie with history?\",\" added S Jaishankar in an interview to ANI.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comAsked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remarks that S Jaishankar did not know much about foreign policy and needed to learn a little bit more, the External Affairs Minister took a veiled dig and said he is willing to listen to the Wayanad MP if he has \"superior knowledge and wisdom\" on China.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The court said that the prosecution could not prove the allegations. (Representational)New Delhi:A Delhi Court has acquitted a man accused of abusing and threatening to kill Prime Minister Modi. The court acquitted the accused giving him the benefit of doubt. The court said that the prosecution could not prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. The court raised serious questions about the manner the investigation was conducted and the non-joining of public witnesses.Metropolitan Magistrate Shubham Devadiya of Tis Hazari Court acquitted Mohd. Mukhtar from the offence of threat to kill PM giving the benefit of the doubt.A case was registered at Police Station Anand Parbat under sections related to using abusive language and threats in January 2019.The judge said, \" this Court is of the opinion that the Prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts and accordingly, accused Mohd. Mukhtar Ali stands acquitted of charge u/s 506(II) IPC.\"The Court noted that the whole case of the Prosecution that a call was received from a mobile number at the police control room wherein statements in the form of threats to kill PM Modi was made by the accused does not appear to be reliable.The court also noted that ASI Raj Kumar has clearly stated that he implicated the present accused after he called at the above-said number and the receiver of the above-said number, who is the brother of the accused, led him to the discovery of the present accused shows the callous way of investigating the present case and does not inspire much confidence in the Prosecution story.Accordingly, this Court finds that the Prosecution has miserably failed to bring on record any evidence which could have shown or proved any statement in the form of threats to kill anyone has ever been made, the judge said in the judgement.The court also said that the perusal of all the evidence led by the prosecution as well as the defence put by the Legal Aid Counsel (LAC), this Court is of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to bring on record any evidence which could have shown that the offence of Section 506(II) IPC has been committed by the accused.The General Diary (GD) entry is the only piece of evidence that substantiates the allegations put forth by the prosecution, however, the perusal of the GD entry reflects that it is handwritten and in the absence of PCR form the evidentiary value of the said GD entry is feeble in nature, the court added.Moreover, the prosecution has failed to prove the ingredients of Section 506(II) IPC as the prosecution has not been able to show the intention of the accused to cause alarm to the victim, the court noted.The court also referred to the decision of the High Court of Delhi wherein it held that mere bald and general assertions of threats to kill anyone are not sufficient in themselves to bring a case under Section 506(II) IPC.The court said that the prosecution has failed to prove that any serious effort was made by recovery witnesses who were police officials to join public witnesses in the proceedings.From a perusal of the record, no serious effort for joining public witnesses appears to have been made. Section 100 (4) of the CrPC also casts a statutory duty on an official conducting a search to join two respectable persons of the society, the court said.Further, there is nothing on record to show that recovery witnesses/police officials had served any notice upon the persons who refused to join the investigation, it addedThe court observed, \"Joining independent witnesses would have given credibility to the recovery proceeding. Therefore, non-joining of independent witness casts a doubt on the fairness of the investigation.\"This Court is, however, conscious that the prosecution case cannot be thrown out or doubted on the sole ground of non-joining of public witnesses as public witnesses keep themselves away from the Court unless it is inevitable, the court said.\"However, in the present case, it is not only the absence of public witnesses which raises a doubt on the prosecution but there are other circumstances too, as discussed hereinafter, which raise suspicion over the prosecution version, \" the court observed.The facts of the case are that on 17.01.2019 at 11:00 AM, the accused used abusive language and threatened to kill PM Modi. FIR was registered under Section 506(II) IPC.After the completion of the investigation chargesheet was filed in the Court. The cognizance of the offence was taken and a summon was issued to the accused.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe charge was framed against the accused for an offence punishable under Section 506(II) IPC on 28.09.2022 to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Let him sit there for few more days. Let's see what will happen in the days to come. We are trying to unite various parties to put a united fight against the BJP,\" Mr Kharge said.Speaking at a party meeting , he said PM Modi did not become Prime Minister with 51 per cent vote share as the BJP got just 37 per cent in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. \"Let PM Modi say what he has done to our state?\" Mr Kharge said while hitting out at the government on the issues of unemployment and price rise, among other issues.Mr Kharge was addressing Tumakuru district-level Congress workers' meeting in Koratagere.Accusing BJP of creating a rift within the society, he said the ruling party is instigating clashes between Hindus and Muslims, and between different castes.\"Such a party's government is there at the Centre and also in the state. Instead of development and welfare of people, what should be the dress worn to schools, what should be the food habit are their main issues. Root out this BJP government for a happy and prosperous future. All of you (people) should take this pledge and bring Congress back to power,\" he added.AICC General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala, state Congress President DK Shivakumar, party manifesto committee chief G Parameshwara, among other leaders were present at the event.Pointing to PM Modi's recent visit to his former Lok Sabha constituency Kalaburagi, Mr Kharge said: \"Using government's money, car and aircraft, instead of working for the development of the state, how right is it on PM's part to criticise people like me and Sonia Gandhi, alleging we did nothing for the country?\" \"Have the people made you Prime Minister and gave you power to work for the welfare of the people and to develop the country, or is it to criticise us?\" he asked, directing his queries to Modi as he accused the BJP government of misusing the Constitution and autonomous bodies to bring down the governments of Congress and other non-BJP parties in the country.Questioning as to what PM Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah have to say about 40 per cent commission and corruption charges faced by the BJP government in Karnataka, Mr Kharge asked them to speak about it.\"Corruption is taking place just below you, but you are not looking at it....you say bhaiyo or behno (brothers and sister - the words with which Modi usually begins his speech), and allow them (BJP leaders) here to do 40 per cent (commission corruption), and send rest for the party, so combining both it is 100 per cent,\" he said.Alleging 100 per cent corruption with high estimation on projects among other irregularities by the BJP in Karnataka, Mr Kharge said, \"This is my 52nd year in politics as MLA and MP, other then losing last MP election from Gulbarga (in 2019), I have won 11 elections successively, but have never seen such a Prime Minister.\" Wherever this Prime Minister goes, he criticises Congress and its leaders, Mr Kharge said, adding: \"Tell what you have done for the country, your own party government's corruption, other than criticisng the Congress wherever you go.\" Hitting back at PM Modi's umbrella jibe at the Congress party, the AICC president said the Prime Minister did not find anything good from the party's plenary session in Raipur, like the resolutions passed, the statement on foreign affairs, unemployment and inflation, among others. \"Leaving everything aside, what he only saw was there was no umbrella over my head.\"At a rally in Belagavi recently, PM Modi claimed that Mr Kharge, who hails from the state, was insulted and disrespected by the Congress in favour of a \"family\", despite his seniority and age, pointing out that a leader from Nehru-Gandhi family got an umbrella as shade under the scorching heat at Raipur, but not for the party chief.Chiding the BJP for not showing any shame, Mr Kharge said, \"They protect the corrupt, and put ED and Income Tax behind political opponents, but stay quiet when crores of rupees of ill-gotten money is found in the house of their own people.\" \"Why are you sitting with your eyes shut? Where is your ED, Income Tax departments? Are they sleeping, are you controlling them to follow as you say?\" he questioned pointing at Lokayukta raids on a BJP MLA's son and family properties, during which more than Rs 8 crore was recovered.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Congress brought freedom to this country, we did not fear British, will we fear you (BJP)?

The BJP has accused Mr Gandhi of maligning India abroad after repeated electoral defeats, after his address at his alma mater Cambridge University.\"I recall the Prime Minister going abroad and announcing that nothing has been done in the 60 or 70 years of Independence,\" Mr Gandhi told reporters at an India Insights event organised by the Indian Journalists' Association (IJA) on Saturday evening.\"I remember him saying there was a lost decade... there is unlimited corruption in India.

That's fine,\" he added.\"But the fact remains that the person who defames India when he goes abroad is the Prime Minister of India... You have not heard his speech where he said nothing has been done in India since Independence, insulting every Indian parent, grandparent?\" he added.PM Modi was slammed by the Congress in August 2015 for his comment in Dubai that he has \"inherited problems of indecision, lethargy from the previous government\".In May that year, during a visit to South Korea, he had said: \"There used to be a point in time when people used to regret being born in India and leaving the country saying it is no good. They wanted to leave for better opportunities... Now, those people are saying they are ready to come back even if their incomes are lower than in other places.

Sources indicated that Manik Saha is the front-runner, though a section in the state party is rooting for union minister Pratima Bhowmik.The meeting at the home of the party's chief strategist Amit Shah was attended by the party chief JP Nadda, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio.Mr Rio, whose party won 25 seats remains the Chief Minister. In Meghalaya too, the senior partner National People's Party headed by Conrad Sangma will be in the driving seat. Mr Sangma will remain in the top post.The other crucial question for the meet was the number of berths to be allotted to the BJP in Mehghalaya and Nagaland. Sources indicated that in Meghalaya, one of the two BJP MLAs will get a ministerial berth. The number in Nagaland is yet to be decided.In Tripura, Chief Minister Manik Saha submitted his resignation on Friday. Though the BJP had indicated that he will continue in the top post if the party returned to power, the leaner majority of the party compared to 2018 had put a question mark on it.His detractors have been asking for a change, demanding that Ms Bhowmick be the first woman Chief Minister of Tripura.Mr Saha's predecessor Biplab Deb was removed a year before the election when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the BJP, found out that his brash actions and poor law and order record had caused a dent in the popularity of the party.Mr Saha, who was swiftly brought into the picture, has made his mark as a genteel leader critical of political violence or hooliganism.Tripura has also been making headlines recently, with the BJP as recently as yesterday claiming they are ready to resume talks with former royal and Tipra Motha supremo Pradyot Kishore Debbarma.The tribal party, which emerged as the second-largest in the Assembly polls, has a long-standing demand for 'Greater Tipraland' bringing the two parties into a deadlock.\"Tipra Motha has raised certain issues for the development of the tribal people.

It is not the EC that will decide whether I want it or not,\" he said.He further added saying, \"Kapil Sibal is fighting our case and he is worried for us. While arguing in the Supreme Court, he said that he is not worried about winning or losing the case, instead, he is worried about whether Democracy and Constitution will survive in the country or not.\"Uddhav Thackeray also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party, accusing it of \"stealing\" figures like Subhash Chandra Bose, Sardar Patel and Bala Saheb Thackeray.\"Sardar Patel banned RSS, but they (BJP) stole the name of Sardar Patel. Similarly, they stole Subhash Chandra Bose and did the same with Bala Saheb Thackeray. I challenge them to ask for votes in PM Modi's name and not in the name of Shiv Sena and without Bala Saheb's photo,\" he said.Earlier on February 17, in a major setback to the Uddhav Thackery faction of Shiv Sena, the Election Commission of India (ECI) allotted the party name \"Shiv Sena\" and the symbol \"Bow and Arrow\" to the faction led by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde.While the Shinde faction welcomed the decision of being recognized as the real Shiv Sena, the Uddhav Thackeray faction said they will move the Supreme Court.The Commission observed in its order that the current constitution of the Shiv Sena party is undemocratic and has been \"mutilated to undemocratically appoint people from a coterie as office bearers without any election at all\". It said such party structures fail to inspire confidence.The poll panel advised all political parties to reflect democratic ethos and principles of inner party democracy and regularly disclose on their respective websites aspects of their inner party functioning, such as organisational details, holding of elections, the copy of the Constitution and list of office bearers.\"The constitution of political parties ought to provide for free, fair and transparent elections to the posts of office bearers and a further free and fair procedure for the resolution of internal disputes. These procedures ought to be difficult to amend and should be amendable only after ensuring larger support of the organisational members for the same,\" the ECI said.Last month, both the Maharashtra Chief Minister Shinde and former CM Uddhav Thackeray-led factions of the Shiv Sena submitted their written statements in support of their claims over the party name and symbol to the Election Commission.The ECI had frozen the bow and arrow symbol of the Shiv Sena and had allotted the 'Two Swords and Shield symbol' to the Eknath Shinde faction of Shiv Sena and the 'flaming torch' (mashaal) election symbol was allotted to the Uddhav Thackeray faction for the bypoll in Andheri East assembly constituency in November last year.Shiv Sena had seen a split last year forcing Uddhav Thackeray to resign as Chief Minister of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Shinde later joined hands with BJP to form a government in the state.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "There should be no outside interference with the functioning of the judiciary, UU Lalit (File)Kolkata:Former chief justice of India U U Lalit said the judiciary has faced instances of challenge and attempts at interference but dealt with these appropriately to ensure its independence.He said in order to have a thriving democracy, one must have an independent judiciary because it is through dispute resolution that society is assured of governance by the rule of law. \"There are various challenges that the judiciary has to face today,\" he said, asserting, \"therefore, we have to be strong as a judicial fraternity... We must bear every kind of pressure, onslaught or any kind of interference.\" Speaking at a symposium on 'Independent judiciary: Critical for a vibrant democracy' held by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here on Saturday evening, he said there have been instances of court decisions subjected to executive interference, but these have been appropriately dealt with ensuring the independence of the judiciary.The former CJI said attributes of independence of the judiciary are impartiality, fairness in action, reasonableness and complete integrity for the purpose of dispute resolution.Noting that the \"citadel never falls except from within\", the former CJI said this is the expression with which the district judiciary is to be protected.UU Lalit said the district judiciary is not under the control of anybody except the high court in the state.\"All their postings, promotions, appointments and even transfers are supposed to be only at the recommendation of the high courts,\" he said.Holding there should be no outside interference with the functioning of the judiciary, he said a number of articles in the Constitution ensure there is no interference in the functioning of every individual judge or the judiciary in general.\"One way to ensure the independence of the judiciary is to have an atmosphere where the people responsible for discharging judicial functions must have a sense of complete freedom and lack of interference from any agency,\" he said.The ex-CJI said the shoulders of the judiciary are quite strong to deal with any kind of external onslaught from any force.Supreme Court judge Justice Hima Kohli said the independence of the judiciary is not just a principle but a moral imperative.\"The relevance of an independent judiciary cannot be overstated, especially in a country like ours which is not just a democratic republic; it has been described in the Constitution as a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic,\" she said.Justice Kohli said to discharge constitutional duties, the judiciary must be independent and impartial.\"It must be free from any external and internal influence,\" she said, maintaining that judicial independence is not just a facet of the fundamental rights of citizens but also an essential condition for maintaining a vibrant and democratic social order.She said the independence of the judiciary has been upheld by the Supreme Court in a host of landmark cases.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
