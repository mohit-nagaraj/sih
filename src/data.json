The alliance leaders had earlier met in Patna and Bengaluru earlier this year. The other agenda for the Opposition bloc remains appointment of spokespersons and grouping's logo.Launching a scathing attack on the BJP, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the strength of the opposition alliance is making the government \"nervous\". He told the INDIA bloc partners to prepare for vendetta politics as there will be more \"misuse\" of agencies against them.While West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is learnt to have told the leaders that the bloc should release its manifesto by October 2, Mr Kharge asked them to prepare a common agenda to counter the BJP on national level.Last night, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray hosted a formal dinner for the Opposition leaders. At the meeting, several leaders expressed apprehension about early polls. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the opposition should be ready to take on the NDA's \"surprise element strategy and gimmicks.\"The government has called for a \"special session of Parliament\" to be held from September 18 to 22, drawing strong criticism from the Opposition. Government sources have, so far, been tight-lipped on possible agendas.The leaders said they have come together to save the Constitution and democracy and that the alliance is working to unite the country. \"It is not just a coalition of parties but that of ideas, \" said RJD leader Manoj Jha.Post a comment",

        "text": "The government has also imposed stockpile limits on some crops.India received the lowest August rains since at least 1901, raising concerns about weaker crop output and the potential for more export restrictions following the nation's curbs on rice.The country received 162.7 millimeters of rainfall this month, 36% lower than normal, according to the India Meteorological Department. Total rainfall during June-August was 10% below average, the figures show.Monsoon rains irrigate about half of India's farmland and are crucial for crops such as sugar and soybeans. Erratic weather has hurt some harvests since last year, forcing the nation to restrict exports of wheat and rice to cool domestic retail inflation that surged to a 15-month high in July. The government has also imposed stockpile limits on some crops.September rains will be crucial to make up the shortfall as the monsoon nears its end, especially given the onset of El Nino, which can bring drier conditions. Some main rice-growing regions in the east have had poor rainfall, hurting prospects of the biggest monsoon-sown food grain crop in the area, according to the weather office. The cane areas in the western and southern parts have also seen lower rainfall, it said.Although precipitation in September is forecast to be normal, the four-month monsoon season may end up being below-average, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of the meteorological department, said at a briefing on Thursday.Any decline in production of wheat, rice and sugar in the world's second-biggest grower could put more stress on global food supplies and boost prices of major commodities. Rice prices in Asia are hovering near a 15-year high and sugar prices in New York are up more than 25% this year.Rainfall in the south was 60% below normal in August, the central region received about 47% below average showers, while the northwest witnessed a deficit of about 37%, according to the weather office.Normal to above-normal rains are expected over many areas of India's northeast and adjoining eastern regions next month, Mohapatra said. The foothills of the Himalayas and some areas of the southern region may also get ample rainfall, he said. The maximum average temperature in August was the highest since 1901 across the county, he added.Monsoon rains typically commence at the start of June and reach the whole of the country by July 8, before extending through the end of September. They arrived on June 8 this year.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com--With assistance from Abhay Singh.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The surprise announcement was followed by intense speculation that a bill on 'one nation, one election' would be tabled during the session, but no one from the government has confirmed this.'One nation, one election' refers to holding the Lok Sabha and state assembly polls simultaneously across the country, like it was in the first few rounds of elections in India. The BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have spoken on the issue on several occasions, and it was also a part of the party's manifesto for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.Conducting polls simultaneously was the norm in India until 1967 and four elections were held this way. The practice stopped after some state assemblies were dissolved prematurely in 1968-69. The Lok Sabha was also, for the first time, dissolved a year ahead of schedule in 1970 and mid-term elections had been held in 1971.In its 2014 Lok Sabha Election Manifesto, the BJP had promised to evolve a method for holding the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously.Page 14 of the manifesto had said, \"The BJP is committed to initiate electoral reforms to eliminate criminals. The BJP will seek, through consultation with other parties, to evolve a method of holding Assembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously. Apart from reducing election expenses for both political parties and Government, this will ensure certain stability for State Governments. We will also look at revising expenditure limits realistically.\"PM Modi had spoken on simultaneous elections in 2016 and, shortly after the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, he had called an all-party meeting to discuss the issue. The meeting had been skipped by several opposition parties.The Prime Minister has argued that holding elections every few months puts a burden on the nation's resources and causes a break in governance.In one of the first political reactions to the setting up of the committee, Communist Party of India General Secretary D Raja told NDTV that the BJP is obsessed with one nation, one party and it has been jittery since the opposition united under the INDIA banner.\"One nation, one election is not a new issue. It has been discussed for several years. Ever since the BJP came to power, it has been obsessed with one nation, one culture; one nation, one religion; one nation, one language; one nation, one tax; now one nation, one election; then one nation, one party; one nation, one leader. That is the obsession the BJP is suffering from,\" Mr Raja said.\"Dr Ambedkar said parliament is supreme in our democracy, but the BJP is undermining parliament. Increasingly, our parliament is becoming redundant. But they called a special session. Nobody knows what the purpose is. Ever since the opposition parties came together under the INDIA banner, the BJP has been jittery and desperate. Mr Modi is jittery,\" he added.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comExperts said making the one nation, one election' proposal a reality will require a constitutional amendment and the support of two-thirds of the members in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Assembly polls in five states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram - are due in November-December, and the Lok Sabha polls are expected to be held around May next year.",

        "text": "Government has formed a panel on 'One Nation, One Election' (Representational)New Delhi:The Central government has constituted a panel to explore the possibility of 'One Nation One Election' in the country. A notification about the members of the panel,headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind, is likely to be issued soon.This comes alongside a special Parliament session called by the government from September 18 to 22. The surprise announcement of the session has led to speculations that the government is planning to introduce a bill on \"One Nation, One Election\".The concept refers to holding simultaneous polls across the country. The proposal is to conduct elections for Lok Sabha and all state assemblies at the same time. In India, the general elections to elect the members of Parliament and state assembly polls are held separately when the tenure of the incumbent government comes to an end or it gets dissolved for some reason.The PositivesPrime Minister Narendra Modi has been advocating theOne Nation, One Electionidea for a long time now. In fact, it was one of the components of the Bharatiya Janata Party's election manifesto for the 2014 Lok Sabha Polls.The supporters of 'One Nation One Election' often underline that once implemented, it would bring down the overall expenditure on the electoral process. With so many states, there's always an election in some or the other part of the country, leading to excessive expenditure in the process both by the Election Commission of India (ECI) and contestants.Another argument favouring the One Nation One Election is that it will lead to a more efficient administration. During elections, the entire state machinery focuses on conducting a free and fair electoral process, which impacts the everyday administration because officials are engaged in polling duties. Simultaneous elections will likely boost voter turnout, making it convenient for the electorate to cast the ballot at once.The idea ofOne Nation, One Electionis expected to bring consistency and continuity in policies and programmes of the Central government and states. During the Lok Sabha polls, once the model code of conduct is enforced, no state can launch new projects or schemes until the polls are concluded.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comChallengesThe biggest challenge in the way of the 'One Nation One election' is to sync the terms of the various state legislative assemblies with those of Lok Sabha. There is also no clarity on dealing with situations like midterm polls or the President's rule in case any party fails to get the majority. Regional political parties argue that having the two elections simultaneously would hamper their prospects because they won't be able to highlight local issues prominently. Furthermore, they fear they can't compete with national parties in money and election strategies either.",

Ms Patil, found dead in Karnataka's Belagavi on August 27, had been fighting for custody of her children for nearly three years. This was after New South Wales officials accused Ms Patil and her husband of \"improper care\" and separated the children - both Australian citizens.Ms Patil returned to India earlier this month - to help her father deal with situation. A week later she died by suicide, leaving behind a suicide note blaming some neighbours and the New South Wales Department of Communities and Justice for ruining her family and her life.What Is The Priyadarshini Patil Child Custody Case?Ms Patil, who worked in the IT sector, and her husband were unhappy with treatment provided for one of her children, who media reports indicate suffers from ulcerative colitis - an inflammatory bowel disease causing inflammation and ulcers in the digestive tract.The child was admitted to a private hospital in New South Wales but there was no improvement after six months of care, prompting the parents to seek a medical transfer.According to reports, the request was refused and a child protection case was triggered.The contention was that Amartya's condition had not improved because of \"improper care\" at home. Ms Patil's second child, who is over 18, was also taken into welfare officials' custody.As is protocol in such cases, social workers met the parents and inspected the home environment, and six submitted positive reports but these were replaced by a seventh.Based on this report, child welfare officials took the Patils' children into custody.\"No Concrete Steps Taken So Far\"NDTV spoke to Suranya Aiyar, the child rights lawyer leading the campaign in India to ensure the children are returned, and she stressed the need for an international system that recognises the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child in cases of children who are either Indian citizens or whose parents are new arrivals in a foreign country.\"So far as I am aware, no concrete steps have been taken. The request for the children to be returned to India is quite old... it was made several months before this tragic suicide but there has been no response...\" Ms Aiyar said.\"What we are seeing, again and again in these cases, is that the system is not able to respond to the plight of families, and particularly children, who are either Indian citizens or are new arrivals in a foreign country. And once they are taken away from the parents or, as in this case, once the parental rights have been severely constrained, there have nowhere to go... and the children are, essentially, held hostage by foreign child services authorities.\"Ms Aiyar underlined the fact that \"India is consicous of the existence of crimes against the child\" and that the government is a signatory to the UN's convention on child rights.\"If you can have an international system for the exchange of prisoners based on country of origin... and a system where even someone accused of the worst crimes will have consular access... there is no reason why such children can't be returnd to India when a foreign government assesses parents to be incapable (of caring for the children) in any way.\"Priyadarshini Patil's Legal Battle In Child Custody CaseMultiple media reports indicate Ms Patil and her husband began a long-winded war of red-tape against child welfare officials, whom she accused of \"forcibly\" holding her children.There have also been protests in India - at the Australian High Commission in Delhi - to initiate an inquiry and the Indian government has also become involved, with Union Minister Pralhad Joshi reportedly having promised to contact Australia via the foreign department.What Is The Australian Government Saying?Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said it is \"greatly saddened by the death of an Australian woman in India\" and that it offers its \"deepest condolences\". consular assistance is being provided to Ms Patil's family.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comAccording toThe Hindu, officials have now begun reviewing the case and are in contact with Ms Patil's husband, who flew back to India to perform the rites at his wife's funeral.HelplinesVandrevala Foundation for Mental Health9999666555orhelp@vandrevalafoundation.comTISS iCall022-25521111(Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)",

Consequently, I urge all Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over this development-oriented proposal of 'One Nation, Simultaneous Elections',\" he had said.Mr Kovind, 77, who served as the 14th President of India from 2017 to 2022, had also told all parties at a farewell dinner organised for him at Parliament's Central Hall on July 23, 2022, to shun partisan politics and deliberate on what is essential for people's welfare in the spirit of \"nation first\".Over a year after demitting office, the former president will now head a committee constituted by the government to explore the feasibility of 'one nation, one election'.Even after demitting office as President of India, Mr Kovind has had an active public life and has been delivering lectures and attending various functions.Only two days ago, he met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who visited the former President's residence here.After the meeting, Mr Kovind said he had \"a good conversation on various national issues\".\"His insights into our nation's progress and values are truly inspiring,\" Mr Kovind said after meeting Bhagwat.Known as someone who has risen from being a grassroots-level politician to becoming the country's first citizen, Mr Kovind, in his speeches over the years, has often referred to his humble background and talked about how he grew up in a mud house in a small village and that his journey to the presidency had been a long one.Born in Paraunkh village in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur district, Mr Kovind enrolled as an advocate with the Bar Council of Delhi in 1971 and served as counsel for the Union government in the Delhi High Court from 1977 to 1979.In 1978, he became an advocate on record with the Supreme Court of India. From 1980 to 1993, Mr Kovind was the standing counsel for the Union government in the Supreme Court.He was elected a member of the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh in April 1994. He served two consecutive terms of six years each until March 2006.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMr Kovind was appointed governor of Bihar on August 8, 2015.He was the second Dalit to occupy the top constitutional post after K R Narayanan, who was the first Dalit president of the country from July 25, 1997, to July 25, 2002.",

The articles that would require amending are:1. Article 83 (2): It says the Lok Sabha's term should not exceed five years but it may be dissolved sooner.2. Article 85 (2) (B): A dissolution ends the very life of the existing House and a new House is constituted after general elections.3. Article 172 (1): A state assembly, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years4. Article 174 (2) (B) - The Governor has the power to dissolve the assembly on the aid and advice of the cabinet. He Governor can apply his mind when the advice comes from a Chief Minister whose majority is in doubt.5. Article 356 - Imposition of President's Rule in states.For a Constitutional Amendment, two-third members of the House must be present for the vote. A consensus of all political parties and state governments is needed.After the Constitutional Amendment Bill is passed in parliament, it needs to be ratified by half the states in India through resolutions in their assemblies.Even if the Constitution is amended to bring about simultaneous Lok Sabha and state polls, huge resources will be needed. This would include over 25 lakhs Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and 25 lakh VVPATs (Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail) to conduct the polls. For perspective, the Election Commission is scrambling with just over 12 lakh EVMs now.Simultaneous polls was the norm in India until 1967 and four elections were held this way. This ended after some state assemblies were dissolved prematurely in 1968-69. The Lok Sabha was also, for the first time, dissolved a year ahead of schedule in 1970 and mid-term elections were held in 1971.In its 2014 Lok Sabha Election Manifesto, the BJP had promised to work on holding assembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously.A parliamentary standing committee had highlighted that in South Africa, elections to national as well as provincial legislatures are held simultaneously for five years and municipal elections are held two years later.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIn Sweden, elections to the national legislature (Riksdag) and provincial legislature/county council (landsting) and local bodies/municipal assemblies (Kommunfullmaktige) are held on a fixed date - the second Sunday in September for four years.In the UK, the term of parliament is governed by the Fixed-term Parliament Act, 2011.",

        "text": "Chandrayaan-3 landed on the moon's surface on August 23New Delhi:What was known in theory has now been confirmed twice. The Chandrayaan-3 mission has authenticated the presence of sulphur on the lunar south pole region after on site tests, a historical first that could provide clues to the origins of the Moon and also have profound significance for space exploration, say scientists.On Thursday, India's space agency ISRO said the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectroscope (APXS) instrument onboard thePragyan roverconfirmed the presence of sulphur and some other elements in the lunar south. Before that, on Tuesday, ISRO announced that another instrument, the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS), found sulphur in the region.Also Read |ISRO's Latest Video On Rover Roaming On Moon Has A \"Chandamama\" ReferenceIn line with expectations, ISRO also reported the LIBS instrument had detected aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon and oxygen.\"The elements found on the Moon are not merely isolated compounds. They are time capsules carrying the whispers of cosmic history. Such findings not only reshape our comprehension of lunar formations but also offer potential prospects for lunar exploration and habitation,\" Akash Sinha, who was involved in developing software for the Pragyan rover, told PTI.\"One prevailing theory is that the sulphur may be trapped within water ice, implying that we might be on the brink of a monumental discovery: the physical presence of water ice on the moon,\" the professor of practice at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence in Delhi-NCR added.An old undated document from the US space agency NASA suggested the potential utilisation of sulphur for making lunar bricks or concrete using it with moon soil. Interestingly, China's reported plans to test printing bricks from lunar soil this decade for constructing a permanent moon base align with this idea.The revelation of sulphur's presence might hold clues to the Moon's composition and its volcanic past, scientists said.\"Surface sulphur comes from volcanic activity, indicating heavy volcanism at some point in the Moon's history. However, the detection is from only one spot, so we need more data to gain a clearer picture,\" said T V Venkateswaran, a scientist at Vigyaan Prasar, an autonomous organisation under the Department of Science and Technology (DST).Sinha added that the discovery of sulphur represents a significant breakthrough in the understanding of lunar geology.\"The presence of sulphur, especially in an area where volcanic activity-a common source of sulphur-is notably absent opens up intriguing possibilities about the origins of the Moon,\" he said.According to astrophysicist Sandip Chakrabarti, the in-situ measurements definitively confirm sulphur's presence in the region, a feat beyond the capabilities of the instruments on the previous Chandrayaan 1 and 2 orbiters.\"The compositions show abundant lighter metals such as aluminium and also abundant sulphur and iron. Sulphur could come from lunar volcanoes. Only traces of heavy metals such as titanium, and chromium, were found. These are along the expected lines,\" Chakrabarti, director of the Indian Center for Space Physics in Kolkata, told PTI.These elements, he explained, aren't in their pure form and would need processing for future extraction.\"The discoveries made by Chandrayaan-3 hold vast implications for lunar exploration. Beyond the allure of space travel, the presence of these elements paints a vivid picture of the Moon's character,\" Chakrabarti reflected.Experts also believe that aluminium's lightweight strength could become a resource for future missions, potentially transforming the Moon into a launchpad for further space exploration. Calcium's critical role in biological processes could fuel discussions about the Moon's potential as a scientific research hub.Chakrabarti expressed his enthusiasm for Pragyan's contribution. \"It is indeed heartening that Pragyan is actually sending the composition of the topsoil of the landing area, namely, Shiv-Shakti point.\" He also highlighted the need for helium, hydrogen and water for future space travel, survival and power generation.\"Right now, we are concentrating on survival on the Moon and not getting richer,\" he added.ISRO has initiated a thorough investigation into the presence of hydrogen.Venkateswaran, who is also a member of the outreach committee of the Astronomical Society of India, emphasised the rover's role in confirming a finding from Chandrayaan-1 about hydrogen particles reflected by the Moon's surface in 2008.\"We do need to see water in any of its forms and hydrogen.

Thousands of personnel from other government security services including the home guards and the para-military Border Security Force will be brought in to maintain law and order, he said.\"To contain protests and gatherings, we will have adequate and robust police presence.\"While Pathak is in charge of security in the city, the main venue will be guarded by a team under another Delhi Police special commissioner, Ranvir Singh Krishnia.Although the capital is relatively peaceful, as recently as last month, communal tensions flared up in the neighbouring industrial township of Gurugram in which at least seven people were killed.During the weekend summit, New Delhi's borders will be closely guarded and access to the city will be regulated, officials said.Within the city of 20 million, the government is planning a partial shutdown during the summit with schools, government departments and businesses being asked to remain closed for three days.DEFENCE IN THE SKIESThe city will be guarded by nearly 130,000 security personnel, including the 80,000-strong Delhi Police, officials said.A spokesperson for the Indian Air Force told Reuters that it will \"deploy comprehensive measures for integrated aerospace defence in the Delhi and close-by areas.\"The spokesperson said that the Indian military, including the air force, along with the Delhi Police and paramilitary forces, will deploy anti-drone systems to prevent any aerial threats. About 400 firefighters will also be on call.Security control rooms are being set up at the venue and special security arrangements have been made at key hotels like the ITC Maurya Hotel, where Biden will stay.Prime Minister Modi has converted India's year-long presidency of the G20 into a national event, with different meetings of the group being hosted in key parts of the country, including far-flung Arunachal Pradesh state and Srinagar city in Kashmir.Throughout the year, roads, airports, bus stops, parks, railway stations, government offices and government media have been plastered with G20 advertisements.In New Delhi, new fountains and ornamental plants adorn key traffic roundabouts while life-size cutouts of langurs - a large monkey with black face - have been put up in several areas to fight the city's monkey menace.Prime Minister Modi inaugurated a $300 million venue in the capital in July to host the summit meeting - a conch shell-shaped building that can seat more than 3,000.The government has also leased 20 bullet-proof limousines at a cost of 180 million Indian rupees ($2.18 million) for ferrying leaders.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMany world leaders travel with their own bodyguards and vehicles.

        "text": "The researchers noted that previous studies on the subject lacked depth.New Delhi:Sri Lanka's two largest ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Sri Lankan Tamils, who were engaged in a longstanding civil war, are genetically more similar to each other than any other South Asian population group, according to a study.The research, published on Friday in thejournal iScienceand conducted jointly by Indian and Sri Lankan DNA scientists, sheds light on the historical origins of the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka as well as their social interactions.The researchers noted that despite significant cultural and linguistic differences, the two groups intermingled in the past for several hundred years, which resulted in genetic affinity.\"Though the majority Sinhalese and the minority Sri Lankan Tamils entered into a bloody conflict during the colonial era, which continued till 2009 with the end of the civil war, mutual distrust and enmity still exist between them. However, our findings are truly intriguing,\" Professor Gyaneshwer Chaubey from the Department of Zoology, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, said.Besides BHU, the team includes researchers from the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, Mangalore University, Mangalore, and the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka.The researchers noted that Sri Lanka's major ethnic group is Sinhalese, which is 74.9 percent. Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims (locally known as Moors) are 11.1 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively. Indian Tamils are the fourth population group with 4.1 percent, and a very small percentage constitute Burgher, Malay, Vedda (Adivasi), etc.The study found that both ethnic communities-the Sinhalese and the Sri Lankan Tamils-migrated to Sri Lanka from India around 500 BC, i.e., 2,500 years ago.\"While the Sinhalese migrated to Sri Lanka from the western part of India, Sri Lankan Tamils relocated from southern India, both around the same time. There seems to be a flow of genes from both sides for hundreds of years, resulting in this genetic affinity,\" said R. Ranasinghe, a senior scientist at the University of Colombo.The researchers noted that previous studies on the subject lacked depth in terms of gene mapping, and hence their findings were inconclusive.\"This is the first study that has been done on half a million genetic mutations in an individual. Due to its vast and intensive scope of work, we believe that the outcome is robust and conclusive,\" Chaubey said.The team noted that normally, it has been observed that an individual's genetic profile has some commonality with his or her surroundings.\"For instance, a person who belongs to the northern part of the country shares a great deal of genetic similarity with other people from other cities in North India, but in the Sri Lankan study, we found a higher West Indian genetic component than in South India, with traces of common roots of Sinhala and Maratha,\" Ranasinghe said.\"Another startling aspect is the strong gene flow between Sri Lankan Tamils and Sinhalese beyond the boundary of ethnicity and language, which is unusual in a South Asian context,\" he added.The team of scientists also observed that the legends say that Sinhala came from Sinhapura, which is located in India; however, scholars have disputed the correct location.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"There are two schools of thought; one says it is North-West India, whereas the other says West Bengal. This study confirmed North-West India as their homeland,\" Niraj Rai, another DNA scientist from the Ancient DNA Lab at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, said.The study took five years and involved, besides an extensive study and analysis, the collection of 834 DNA samples from Sri Lankan Tamils (88), Sinhalese (129), Indian Tamils from Sri Lanka (56), and Indian Tamils from India (562).",

The government also frequently talked about its intention to implement it.The Law Commission in 2018 submitted a draft report backing the idea of simultaneous polls. The commission also recommended changes to the electoral laws and constitutional provisions and examined the legal and constitutional constraints.The Law Commission says simultaneous elections can only be held through appropriate amendments to the Constitution.

        "text": "As the two stripped down to their undergarments, policewomen rushed to cover them.Guwahati:Women staged a semi-nude protest in Assam's largest city Guwahati against an eviction drive in Silsako Beel (lake) area on Friday, as excavators ravaged to the ground several houses to clear alleged encroached land of the wetland.As police and civil administration reached the area to carry out the eviction, local people came out in protest.Initially raising slogans against the government and trying to prevent the police personnel from entering the area, two women protestors disrobed themselves.As the two stripped down to their undergarments, policewomen rushed to cover them and were taken away from the site, along with several other protestors.The eviction drive was carried out with several excavators pressed into action to demolish the houses in the area.A couple whose house was demolished claimed that they had bought the land for Rs 4 lakh in 2007 from a local 'committee', which had assured them that no eviction would happen in the area.\"The government has thrown us out so that they can sell this land to the rich for crores of rupees. Where will we go now? Our lives are over,\" they said.Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claimed that the exercise was carried out after due consultation with the residents and compensation would be paid to those eligible for it.\"There was a discussion with the public for the last three days and the eviction was done after reaching an understanding. The district commissioner had informed the people about the compensation to be paid. We will build flats for the landless evicted people,\" Chief Minister Sarma said, talking to reporters on the sidelines of a programme in Nagaon.He maintained that those protesting are from a specific organisation, though he did not name any group.\"They will protest against anything we do. We will take strict action against them,\" the chief minister added.Criticising the government over the eviction drive, opposition party Assam Jatiya Parishad chief Lurinjyoti Gogoi alleged that women are no longer safe under BJP rule.\"We are shocked and distressed at such a protest. For the first time, women had to strip and protest in our state,\" he said.President of the youth wing of state Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Rudrangkur Hazarika, maintained that the women had to take such a step to register their protest as the government has turned a deaf ear to their problems.\"The government has not been able to solve any problem of the people. The women were left with no option to get the government's attention,\" he said.Condemning the incident, Assam Trinamool Congress spokesperson Dilip Sarma said, \"The BJP had talked about protecting the land of the indigenous people. And now, Assamese women are being forced to disrobe and protest against the government.\" An eviction drive in Silkalo lake was carried out earlier this year also, with the government initiating the process to procure back land in the wetland area that was allotted to various government and private bodies many decades ago.Initially, the Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) had planned to target only around 450 buildings within 100 metres on both sides of the lake, which was around 400 bighas (over 132 acres), but the government later expanded the exercise to make the entire water body encroachment free.The government in 2008 had declared Silsako Beel, surrounded by Chachal, Hengerabari, Pathar Quarry and Satgaon areas, a protected water body in Guwahati through an act and prohibited any construction or settlement in around 1,800 bighas (over 595 acres) of lake area.A GMDA official had said that less than 300 bighas of the lake remained free from encroachment and the waterbody was reduced to a small pit, which is believed to be a major reason for water logging in the eastern part of the city.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMost of the people affected are from Assamese communities like Bodo, Mising, Karbi, Ahom and Bishnupriya Manipuri.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Holding simultaneous polls would need any no-confidence motion to be coupled with a confidence motionNew Delhi:Holding simultaneous polls for Lok Sabha and all assemblies would need any no-confidence motion to be coupled with a 'confidence motion' by a leader proposed as next prime minister or chief minister, while any mid-term election can be conducted only for remainder of the term, the Election Commission had said earlier.Proposing amendments to the Constitution, the EC had said the term of Lok Sabha would normally commence and expire on a particular date (and not on the date on which it completes five years from the date of its first sitting).The period for general election to constitute the new House should be so determined that Lok Sabha could commence its term on the pre-determined date.To avoid premature dissolution of Lok Sabha, any no-confidence motion against the government should \"necessarily include\" a further 'confidence motion' in favour of a government to be headed by a named individual as the future prime minister and voting should take place for the two motions together, the EC had said while sharing its suggestions on simultaneous polls.The poll panel had also suggested that in case the dissolution of the House cannot be avoided, then fresh elections can be held if the remainder of the term is long.In such a case, the term of the House should be for the rest of what would have been the original term.It had said if the remainder of the term of the Lok Sabha is not long, there could be a provision for the President to carry out the administration of the country on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers to be appointed by him/her till, the time the next House is constituted at the prescribed time.It had suggested similar arrangement for state legislative assemblies.It had said the terms \"long\" and \"not long\" should be defined.The department-related standing committee on law and personnel, which came out with a report on \"Feasibility of holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies\" in December 2015 had cited the suggestions made by the EC on the issue.\"The terms of all State Legislative Assemblies should also normally come to an end on the date on which term of the Lok Sabha is expiring.\"That may also mean, to begin with as one time measure, that the term for the existing Legislative Assemblies will have to be either extended beyond five years or curtailed so that fresh elections can be held simultaneously with Lok Sabha election,\" the report of the parliamentary panel had said citing EC's suggestions.If no party is able to form a government after elections, and another poll becomes necessary, the term of the House in such case after the fresh election should be only for the remainder of what would have been the original term, the poll panel had suggested.Similarly, if a government has to resign for some reason and an alternative is not possible, then provision can be considered for a fresh election if the remainder of the term is comparatively longer period and in other cases, rule by the governor or President's Rule.The EC said two windows of one-and-a-half months each may be fixed for holding all by-elections that become due in a particular year.As an alternative, EC said provisions to have all elections, falling due in a year together in a particular period of the year can be considered.\"In this arrangement, the advantage would be that the general elections to various Legislative Assemblies falling due in a year will be held together and not at different periods in the year. In the year in which the Lok Sabha election is due , all the Assembly elections of that year may also be held,\" the poll panel said.The EC also pointed out several difficulties which might be encountered for conducting simultaneous elections. The chief issue highlighted by it was that simultaneous conduct of elections would require large scale purchase of Electronic Voting Machines and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines.For conducting simultaneous elections, the Commission expects that a total of Rs 9284.15 crore will be needed for procurement of EVMs and VVPATs.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe machines would also be need to be replaced every 15 years which would again entail expenditure. \"Further, storing these machines would increase the warehousing cost,\" the standing committee said citing EC's inputs.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph is the largest payload on Aditya-L1.Bengaluru:The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), the primary payload of Aditya L1 - the first space based Indian mission to study the Sun, set for launch on Saturday - will be sending 1,440 images per day to the ground station for analysis on reaching the intended orbit.VELC, \"the largest and technically most challenging\" payload on Aditya-L1, was integrated, tested, and calibrated at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics's (IIA) CREST (Centre for Research and Education in Science Technology) campus in Hoskote near here with substantial collaboration with ISRO. Aditya-L1 will be launched by PSLV-C57 rocket on September 2 at 11:50 AM. It carries seven payloads to study the Sun, four of which will observe the light from the Sun and the remaining three will measure insitu parameters of the plasma and magnetic fields.Aditya-L1 will be placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrangian Point 1 (L1), which is 1.5 million km from the Earth in the direction of the Sun. It will revolve around the Sun with the same relative position and hence can see the Sun continuously.\"From the continuum channel, which is the imaging channel, an image will come -- one image per minute. So approximately 1,440 images for 24 hours, we will be receiving at the ground station,\" Aditya L1 Project Scientist and Operation Manager for VELC Dr Muthu Priyal said.She said, IIA will host the VELC Payload Operations Centre (POC), which will receive raw data from ISRO's Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC), process them further to make it suitable for scientific analysis, and send it back to ISSDC for dissemination.\"Also a unique software has been developed by IIA to detect automatically the occurrence of coronal mass ejection and the time it happened, which will be provided to science community within 24 hours -- whether it is directed towards the earth or whether it is a very energetic event, if the speed is high, will it hit the earth or not, etc -- all those information will be made available,\" she added.According to IIA officials, 190 kg VELC payload will send images for five years, which is the nominal life of the satellite, but it could last long depending on the fuel consumption, etc.K Sasikumar Raja of IIA further said, out of four channels the continuum channel will run independently and send 1,440 images per day, while the other three spectroscopy channels will also give images, but that is dependent on how the observer wants.The IIA Scientists expect the first images to be available by February-end.\"The satellite is expected to be put into orbit in the middle of January and then we will do the test if all the systems are working properly and by the end of February we expect to get the regular data. It will take time and we have to test instrument by instrument. First we will test the smaller instruments, and the VELC's shutter will be opened last, by mid of February,\" Prof Jagdev Singh said.Explaining the reason for opening the VELC's shutter last, S Nagabushana of IIA said, \"we call it cross contamination. On reaching L1 orbit, the other payloads will be starting first, so that the outgassing coming from the other payloads, should not go and deposit on the primary mirror, which is very super polished and any deposition on the primary mirror will lead to scattering, which can mask the complete coronal mass, which is the field of interest.\" VELC is an internally occulted coronagraph, with 40 different optical elements (mirrors, gratings, etc) inside it that are aligned precisely.The atmosphere of the Sun, the Corona, is what we see during a total solar eclipse. A coronagraph like the VELC is an instrument that cuts out the light from the disk of the Sun, and can thus image the much fainter corona at all times, IIA scientists said.The main science drivers of Aditya-L1 are to understand the origin, dynamics, and propagation of Coronal Mass Ejections and to help solve the Coronal Heating Problem.IIA's solar astronomy community is geared to calibrate and use data from VELC as well as other payloads on Aditya-L1 in the coming months to address fundamental questions about solar astrophysics as well as its impact on our daily lives. VELC can capture images of the solar corona closer to the Sun's disc than any other solar space observatory. This is because of the extremely accurately polished primary mirror, made by LEOS ( Laboratory for Electro Optics Systems) of ISRO, which reduces light scatter inside VELC.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIt can take an image of the corona with high spatial resolution and at an extremely rapid rate (about 3 times a second) in white light and in spectral lines.

Though sporadic incidents of shootings and killings are being reported, those will gradually subside and we are heading towards better times,\" the DG told PTI in an interview.Lt Gen Nair said the country's oldest paramilitary force remains unbiased and has destroyed bunkers, seized weapons and rescued innocent people from both communities in Manipur over the last four months.His remark comes in the wake of controversies alleging that the Assam Rifles is biased towards a particular community in Manipur.\"We are not (biased) and I want to make that absolutely clear.

Without going into the merits of the case, this might set a wrong precedent. You may have 100 per cent merit, not saying anything about that. But to facilitate this, and do this for one person...file an affidavit. It should include the present condition of this person and the stage of the trial,\" the bench observed orally.As the hearing began, the lawyer appearing for Navlakha said the apex court had directed the NIA to file its reply in April on the activist's plea seeking a change of accommodation but the federal anti-terror agency has not submitted its response till date.Senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, appearing for Navlakha, told the bench that the Bombay High Court is scheduled to hear the activist's bail plea and sought time.Raju told the bench the order for placing Navlakha under house arrest is an unusual order which is probably the first of its kind.\"He obtained the house order on grounds of his sickness. He said one lady would stay with him. But she isn't staying most of the time,\" Raju said, insisting the house arrest order is unwarranted.The ASG said Navlakha owes money to the State and urged the bench to direct them to pay at least Rs 20 lakh towards expenses for making available police personnel for his security.Ramakrishnan submitted that NIA's own medical examination confirms Navlakha's ailment.While ordering his house arrest on November 10 last year, the apex court had directed Navlakha to deposit Rs 2.4 lakh towards the expenses to be borne by the state for deploying police personnel to effectively place him under house arrest.At the last hearing, the apex court had directed Navlakha to deposit another Rs 8 lakh as expenses for providing police personnel for his security.On November 10, 2022, the top court had allowed Navlakha, who was then lodged in Navi Mumbai's Taloja prison in connection with the case, to be placed under house arrest owing to his deteriorating health.Noting that the activist has been in custody since April 14, 2020, and prima facie there is no reason to reject his medical report, it had said Navlakha does not have any criminal background except for this case and even the government of India had appointed him as an interlocutor to hold talks with Maoists.Putting a number of conditions, including a deposit of Rs 2.4 lakh as security expenses, the top court had said the order to place the 70-year-old activist under house arrest for a month in Mumbai should be implemented within 48 hours.Since the November 10, 2022 order, the top court has extended his house arrest several times.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which police claim triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial on the outskirts of the city.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Can two items prepared from the same rice grain be the same? It seems the Governor believes in it,\" Mr Basu told reporters.The Governor is the ex-officio chancellor of state universities.\"Don't know under which provisions of the law he is doing these things. CV Ananda Bose is acting without bothering to consult a democratically elected government.

The state will respond as per legal provisions. We are voicing our opposition to what he is doing repeatedly,\" the minister said to queries.The Raj Bhavan Thursday informed about the governor's decision to discharge the duty of the VCs himself till new interim ones are appointed.\"It is observed that students of a few state universities in West Bengal where the VC posts are vacant are facing difficulties in obtaining degree certificates and other documents. To provide them relief, Hon'ble Governor of WB in his capacity as the Chancellor has decided to discharge the duties of the VCs in these Universities till new interim VCs are appointed...,\" the Raj Bhavan said in a statement.The governor also appointed Raj Kumar Kothari as the officiating vice chancellor of the West Bengal State University.In June, the Raj Bhavan issued a statement announcing the appointment of vice-chancellors of 11 state universities, including Calcutta University, Jadavpur University, Rabindra Bharati University, and Burdwan University as the term of their full-time VCs expired after the extension. Mr Bose recently said that he will always cooperate with the state government but that support may not extend to \"whatever it does\".In an interview with PTI, Mr Bose made it clear that in a democracy while the front face of a state is the chief minister and not the nominated governor, each has to stay within the constitutional provisions of their respective 'Lakshman Rekha' (a boundary that should not be crossed).In his capacity as chancellor of West Bengal's state-run or state-supported universities, the governor appointed Justice SK Mukherjee, former chief justice of Karnataka, and retired IPS officer M Wahab as interim VC of Rabindra Bharati University and interim VC of Aliah University respectively.He pointed out that Calcutta High Court has said that on appointments of vice-chancellors, the governor needs to consult the state government, but has upheld that he does not need the state's concurrence in the appointment of VCs. \"There are many people from West Bengal in top academic positions in prestigious foreign universities, IIMs, and IITs who are interested in serving the state.

It will carry seven different payloads to have a detailed study of the sun, four of which will observe the light from the sun and the other three will measure in-situ parameters of the plasma and magnetic fields.The largest and technically most challenging payload on Aditya-L1 is the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph or VELC. VELC was integrated, tested, and calibrated at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics' CREST (Centre for Research and Education in Science Technology) campus in Hosakote in collaboration with ISRO.Aditya-L1 will be placed in a halo orbit around Lagrangian Point 1 (or L1), which is 1.5 million km away from the Earth in the direction of the sun. It is expected to cover the distance in four months' time.This strategic location will enable Aditya-L1 to continuously observe the sun without being hindered by eclipses or occultation, allowing scientists to study solar activities and their impact on space weather in real time. Also, the spacecraft's data will help identify the sequence of processes that lead to solar eruptive events and contribute to a deeper understanding of space weather drivers.Major objectives of India's solar mission include the study of the physics of solar corona and its heating mechanism, the solar wind acceleration, coupling and dynamics of the solar atmosphere, solar wind distribution and temperature anisotropy, and origin of Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) and flares and near-earth space weather.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe atmosphere of the sun, the corona, is what we see during a total solar eclipse.

It was also bound by Article 1. It could not declare that we're not the federal unit of India. They couldn't say that any part of their territory could not be part of India,\" he submitted.Mr Dwivedi, who defended the abrogation, said Article 370 was always considered to be a temporary provision and the speeches of Dr. BR Ambedkar, N.G. Ayyangar (in Constituent Assembly), Jawaharlal Nehru, and Gulzarilal Nanda (in Parliament) clearly indicate that complete assimilation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir at par with other States, in due course, was envisaged from the very beginning.Therefore, Article 370 was mentioned in the Constitution of India as a temporary and transitional, he submitted.\"The framers were conscious that the constituent assembly would be dissolved after framing of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, yet they did not provide that upon dissolution of J-K Constituent Assembly, the power of the President would cease or become defunct. They also did not declare Article 370 as a permanent provision...,\" Mr Dwivedi said.The senior lawyer said this was done for a good reason as the power to repeal Art 370 was vested by the main part in the President of India, who is the head of the State, and is advised by the council of ministers, which is responsible to Parliament.\"The fact that the President has over the years issued several Constitution Orders and has brought about fuller assimilation of J&K and parity with the other States of India shows that the trust was rightly reposed in the President...The constitutional practice shows all relevant actors understood the power of the President as continuing despite cessation of Jammu and Kashmir constituent assembly,\" he added.Senior advocate V Giri, appearing for intervenor 'All India Kashmiri Samaj' submitted that Article 370 of the Constitution, as is textually explicit, was intended by the framers of the Constitution as a temporary provision.\"The cessation of operation of Article 370 has always been considered as dependent on a Presidential Order. Once Article 370 is abrogated, then the entirety of the constitutional provisions, including those providing for distribution of legislative power, exercise of executive authority, separation of powers among different organs of the state and provisions providing for a federal structure, would ipso facto apply,\" he said.The hearing remained inconclusive and would continue on September 4.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comSeveral petitions challenging the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which split the erstwhile state into two union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh - were referred to a Constitution bench in 2019.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Line pencil sketch of unarmed villagers come out to thwart off the advancing armed miscreants approaching the village on armoured vehicles, each with mounted automatic weapons firing away, depicted by a series of dashes, signifying bullets flying towards the opponent side.Village guards are seen putting up a fight, retaliating from the cover of a bunker. The violence is happening in the foothills of four sloping green mountains with a yellow sun shining bright in the sky.This pencil sketch was made by an eight-year-old boy, Khamba (name changed), whose house in Manipur's Churachandpur was completely set on fire on May 3.Since then, Khamba and his widowed mother had been evacuated to Imphal and compelled to live in a relief camp. Khamba has made many such drawings, indicating the trauma he had experienced when his village came under attack and subsequently burnt down to ashes by armed miscreants in Churachandpur.According to the Manipur Social Welfare Department data, over 12,600 displaced children are living in relief camps across the state, and out of them 100 are severely traumatised, needing professional counselling.\"A child may not be traumatised immediately. But that trauma can come up after a week or a month. What we have been doing is - initially our counsellors will visit the relief camps. Whenever they find such severely traumatized children, they will be identified, and taken to professional counsellors. We've done this for little more than 100 children. We hope that this number does not increase and these traumatised children can go back to normal very soon,\" said Ngangom Uttam Singh, Director, Social Welfare Department.To look after mental health of the displaced children, counsellors are deployed through District Children Protection Offices in every district. They visit children homes and relief camps to identify children who require professional help.The department has a team of medical practitioners and child psychiatrists working as volunteers who aid in providing counselling to those who are severely traumatised.Child Psychiatrist Dr Jina Heigrujam, who has visited several relief camps to identify children having PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder, explains why professional counselling is essential to avoid a mental health issues from developing. According to Dr Heigrujam, art and dance therapy are the best techniques that work well with children to get them out of their traumatic experience.\"If stress is prolonged and a child isn't able to adjust to it, many mental health issues can happen. The most common is post-traumatic stress disorder or depression in childhood or anxiety. In order to help them, we've dived deep into the layers to understand how badly they are affected. To do this there are lots of techniques. One of them that works well with children is art therapy,\" the child psychiatrist said.The Social Welfare Department personnel went to relief camps in Wangjing at Thoubal district to identify stress affected children.These personnel are trained to screen for severely traumatised children by a team from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru.At the Lamding relief camp in Thoubal district, where internally displaced residents of Moreh and Serou are sheltered, the specialists identified three-year-old Yaiphaba (name changed) as a traumatised child.Unlike other children of his age and locality, Yaiphaba refused to join in group activities. He is visibly frightened and clings to his aunt. Even luring him with toys and colour pencils do not work. He tightens his hold on his aunt as if sensing danger.All this while, the other kids in the Lamding camp were dancing to a happy tune following the steps of the child specialists. Yaiphaba eases a little when his mother arrives and holds him. Gradually, he gets drawn to the general mood of fun and frolic.According to Yaiphaba's mother, there was a turmoil in their house on the night of May 3 at Moreh when 50-60 people from the locality rushed into their house to take shelter after violence broke out. Miscreants burnt selective shops and houses, she said.

        "text": "The rocket carrying Aditya L1 is scheduled to lift-off todayNew Delhi:India's first solar mission Aditya L1 on board the PSLV will lift off from Sriharikota today for its 125-day voyage towards the Sun. Aditya L1 is designed for providing remote observations of the solar corona and in situ observations of solar wind.Here's your 10-point cheat sheet to this big storyThe liquid apogee motor (LAM) developed by the Liquid Propulsion System Centre (LPSC) will be instrumental in putting the Aditya spacecraft into the Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) orbit, located about 1.5 million km from Earth.The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), the primary payload of Aditya L1, will send 1,440 images per day to the ground station for analysis on reaching the intended orbit.VELC carries seven payloads to study the Sun, four of which will observe the light from the Sun and the remaining three will measure in situ parameters of the plasma and magnetic fields.\"From the continuum channel, which is the imaging channel, an image will come -- one image per minute. So approximately 1,440 images for 24 hours, we will be receiving at the ground station,\" Aditya L1 Project Scientist and Operation Manager for VELC Dr Muthu Priyal told news agency PTI.According to the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), the 190 kg VELC payload will send images for five years, which is the nominal life of the satellite, but it could last long depending on the fuel consumption.IIA scientists expect the first images to be available by February-end. \"The satellite is expected to be put into orbit in the middle of January and then we will do the test if all the systems are working properly and by the end of February we expect to get the regular data,\" professor Jagdev Singh said.\"It will take time and we have to test instrument by instrument. First we will test the smaller instruments, and the VELC's shutter will be opened last, by mid of February,\" he added.Also, the LPSC has been a proven centre of support for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in all its space missions since its inception in 1987. The liquid and cryogenic propulsion systems have been the backbone of India's space ambitions, playing a crucial role in both PSLV and GSLV rockets.The main science drivers of Aditya-L1 are to understand the origin, dynamics, and propagation of coronal mass ejections and to help solve the coronal heating problem.IIA's solar astronomy community is geared to calibrate and use data from VELC as well as other payloads on Aditya-L1 in the coming months to address fundamental questions about solar astrophysics as well as its impact on our daily lives.Post a comment",

It is one of the initiatives of the Reserve Bank with the solid support of the government without their support it would have not been possible. With the support of the government, RBI has been able to make the upi as the largest payment system in the world,\" the RBI governor said.He also said that he was sharing information in his central board meeting on Friday that the number of transactions for the month in the UPI exceeded 10 billion in the month of August. The upi was started in September 2016 and then after the growth has been very steady and now it has crossed 10 billion. But that's not enough, it will grow further.\"We have encouraged digital payment but the main challenge on the upi is that it usually needs a smartphone but in our country a large number of people are using feature phones. We have launched some products to make feature phones to operate the UPI system as well. We have also taken steps to ensure that in areas where there is poor connectivity a wallet, kind of facility through which one can make transactions on the UPI,\" he added.\"We are also among the few countries which have actually launched a pilot project on CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) that is e-rupee. It is nothing but just like paper currency and it is a digital unit of the currency. The pilot project is already in operation and a lot of trials are going on,\" Governor Shaktikanta Das further said.Meanwhile, talking about the inflation he said that the latest inflation print which was released for the month of July on August 14 was quite high which was 7.4 pc. It has taken everybody by surprise but they were expecting the inflation to be substantially higher mainly because of vegetable prices. The tomato prices went up by over 200% and then the impact of the increase of tomato prices went straight to other vegetables so on the whole the vegetable inflation went up.The impact of the vegetable prices which has gone up, they expect to start moderating it from September onwards. In fact the prices of tomatoes have come down, the government has initiated a number of supplies and measures to make tomatoes available in deficient areas at reasonable prices.

The second concern that many of us have is that the big diversity of India actually benefits from the staggered calendar that has evolved over the years,\" Shashi Tharoor said.Former president Ram Nath Kovind was on Friday tasked by the Centre with the responsibility of heading a committee to explore the feasibility of 'one nation, one election'.The committee will explore how the country can go back to having simultaneous Lok Sabha and state assembly polls, as was the case till 1967.Shashi Tharoor said the Chief Executive of the country is selected by a parliamentary majority and a legislative majority, and the moment that majority goes, for whatever reason, the government falls.Then a new election has to be held out of sync with the calendar.He said that between 1947 and 1967, India had all national and state elections on the same date, but the system collapsed when the coalition government fell in 1967 and the calendar slipped.Then the national government fell in 1970, and elections were held in 1971, he said.\"Therefore, that calendar also slipped ... There's been a number of changes, and that's why now there are different calendars for different states. The same thing will happen again in the future,\" Shashi Tharoor said.He said the opposition would attentively listen to Ramnath Kovind's committee on this.\"Let us see if Mr Kovind's committee can come up with any practical solutions.

But also, of course, our electrical grid, our internet grid, and all of the thousands of satellites that we count on that are up in orbit,\" he said.Aditya-L1 will be placed in a halo orbit around Lagrangian Point 1 (or L1), which is 1.5 million km away from the Earth in the direction of the sun. It is expected to cover the distance in four months' time.Mr Hadfield, expressing the expectations of the international space fraternity from Aditya L-1, said, \"Well, everybody on Earth is counting on technology just to have electricity in their homes and businesses to have communications... We are counting on a really complicated interconnected global electric and data system... It's really useful information, not just for ISRO and not just for, obviously the Indian space program, but it's something that is sort of vital space weather for the world.\"Major objectives of India's solar mission include the study of the physics of solar corona and its heating mechanism, the solar wind acceleration, coupling and dynamics of the solar atmosphere, solar wind distribution and temperature anisotropy, and origin of Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) and flares and near-earth space weather.The atmosphere of the sun, the corona, is what we see during a total solar eclipse. A coronagraph like the VELC is an instrument that cuts out the light from the disk of the sun, and can thus image the much fainter corona at all times, the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Astrophysics said.Chris Hadfield called the successful landing of ISRO's moon mission Chandrayaan-3, a \"strong demonstration of the increased capability of Indian technology\".\"It's quite a historic moment for India and for the world.\"He also hailed India's technological advancement saying, \"This example of landing on the moon and sending a probe to the sun or at least to go monitor the sun and getting Indian astronauts ready to fly in space, it provides a really visible example to everybody in India, but to everybody else around the world of just where Indian technological prowess is right now and sort of a hint of everything that's to come.\"On the budget of India's Moon Mission (Chandrayaan-3), former Commander of the International Space Station Chris Hadfield said, \"It's really important to put the budget into perspective... If you compare it to everything else that the Indian government is doing, if you compare it to the amount that's spent on food distribution or the rest of health and welfare for the Indian people, it is like a 100th of 1% of the whole budget... In comparison to what other countries spend in order to do something similar, it's one of India's great strengths as well... It makes them (India) extremely competitive... The inexpensive and successful way that India landed on the Moon, is proof positive for all of those Indian space companies that they can do something as well and for a lot less money than the rest of the world and that is a really good business model.\"In context to pushing the technology in an economic way to turn it into a profitable space business, the former commander of the International Space Station also said, \"India is in a really strong leveraged position to do that.\"\"I think Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seen that for several years. He is very much directly involved with the Indian space and research organization... So it's a really smart move on India's leadership's part right now, to be pushing it, to be developing it, but also being in the process of privatizing it so that the businesses and therefore the Indian people can benefit,\" Mr Hadfield said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comChris Hadfield, who is also an astronaut, has penned the 'Apollo Murders' and is slated to release the next instalment of 'The Defector' in October.\"My new book is 'The Defector', and it comes out October 10.

        "text": "Earlier, Supreme Court had said that it doesn't possess any expertise on this issue.New Delhi:The Supreme Court has posted for September 6 matter relating to the Cauvery water-sharing dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.A bench of Justices BR Gavai and Prashant Kumar Mishra was informed on Friday that in pursuance to its August 25 direction, the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) has submitted its report relating to the compliance of the Authority's August 11 direction by Karnataka to release water so that 10,000 cusecs of water is realised at Biligundulu, Tamil Nadu.CWMA on Thursday filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court stating that a meeting was held and after that, Karnataka fulfilled the directions of CWMA by releasing a total of 149898 cusec of water at Biligundulu from August 12 to August 26.Earlier, the Supreme Court had said that it doesn't possess any expertise on this issue and sought a report from the CWMA on the quantum of release made by Karnataka.It had asked CWMA, which was meeting on August 28, to decide the release of water for the next fortnight in the Cauvery water-sharing dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The Authority in its affidavit stated, \"In the 22nd meeting held on August 11, it was decided that the State of Karnataka has to ensure releases from the Krishna Raja Sagara and Kabini reservoirs put together, so that the flows are realised at Biligundulu at the rate of 10000 cusec, starting from August 12 (8 am) for the next 15 days.\"\"It is respectfully submitted that in the 85th meeting of the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) held on August 28 and thereafter in the 23rd meeting of CWMA held on August 29, the Member from Kamataka informed that as directed by CWMA in its 22nd meeting held on August 11 to ensure realisation of flow of 10000 cusec at Biligundulu, for next 15 days, the State of Karnataka has fulfilled the directions of CWMA by releasing a total of 149898 cusec of water at Biligundulu from August 12 to August 26,\" the affidavit said.It further said that as per the decisions taken in the 23rd meeting of CWMA held on August 29, the CWMA directed the member from Karnataka to ensure the realisation of flows at Biligundulu at the rate of 5000 cusecs, starting from August 29 (8 am) for the next 15 days.Tamil Nadu government had approached the Supreme Court seeking direction to Karnataka to release 24,000 cusecs of water daily per day from the reservoirs in Karnataka.Karnataka government had also filed an affidavit last week opposing Tamil Nadu's application saying that application is based on an assumption that this year is the normal rain water year.The government said that Tamil Nadu's application that Karnataka to ensure the release of 36.76 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) stipulated for September 2023 has no legal basis since the said quantity is stipulated in a normal water year and this water year being a distressed water year so far, it is not applicable.The application is based on an \"erroneous assumption\" that this year is the normal rainwater year, even though, rainfall is lesser by 25 per cent and inflow into four reservoirs in Karnataka was lesser by 42.5 per cent up to August 9 as recorded by the Cauvery Water Management Authority, Karnataka government stated in its affidavit.The matter has been a controversial issue between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for decades and they have been locked in battle over the sharing of water from the Cauvery river, which is a major source of irrigation and drinking water for millions of people in the region.The Centre formed the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) on June 2, 1990, to adjudicate disputes between Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and

current irrigation year for the period between June 1 to July 31.It further asked the Supreme court to direct the Cauvery Water Management Authority to ensure that the directions issued to Karnataka to release water to Tamil Nadu were \"fully implemented and the stipulated monthly releases during the remaining period of the current water year are fully given effect to by the State of Karnataka\".The application said that a direction was given to Karnataka on August 10 to release from its reservoirs 15,000 cusecs at Billigundulu on August 11 for 15 days.\"Unfortunately, even this quantum of water was arbitrarily reduced to 10,000 cusecs by the CWMA in its 22nd meeting held on August 11 at the instance of Karnataka. Regretfully, even this amount of 10,000 cusecs to be ensured at Billigundulu by releasing such quantum of water from the KRS and Kabini reservoirs has not been complied with by Karnataka,\" it added.Karnataka failed to fully implement the directions for the release of the stipulated quantum of 10,000 cusecs (0.864 TMC per day) as directed by CWRC, it said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comKarnataka is duty-bound to release the Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu as per the final order passed by the Tribunal as modified by this Court, the application stated.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The separation ofAditya-L1and its injection into an elliptical orbit around the Earth was successful and took about 63 minutes.PSLV-C57/Aditya-L1 Mission:The launch of Aditya-L1 by PSLV-C57 is accomplished successfully.The vehicle has placed the satellite precisely into its intended orbit.India's first solar observatory has begun its journey to the destination of Sun-Earth L1 point. ISRO (@isro)September 2, 2023Aditya-L1 will be placed in the halo orbit around Lagrange point 1 (L1) of the sun-Earth system, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth. The journey to L1 will take 125 days.Discovered by mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Lagrangian points are places in space where gravitational forces, acting between two objects, balance each other in such a way that spacecraft can remain in a fixed position with minimal fuel consumptionThe L1 point is considered the most significant of the Lagrangian points for solar observations.According to ISRO, the key objectives of the mission are understanding the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration; understanding initiation of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), flares and near-Earth space weather; gaining knowledge of coupling and dynamics of the solar atmosphere; and getting a deeper understanding of solar wind distribution and temperature anisotropy (non-uniformity in different directions).Solar wind refers to a continual stream of protons and electrons from the sun's corona, or outermost atmosphere, while coronal mass ejections are huge expulsions of coronal plasma and magnetic field lines ejected from the sun.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comAditya-L1 is carrying seven different payloads to conduct a detailed study of the sun, four of which will observe the light from the sun and the other three will measure in-situ parameters of the plasma and magnetic fields.The primary payload, Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, will be sending 1,440 images per day to the ground station for analysis after it reaches the orbit around L1.",

        "text": "The Supreme Court quashed a dowry harassment case filed by a woman. (Representational)New Delhi:The Supreme Court has quashed a dowry harassment case filed by a woman against her in-laws, saying she \"clearly wanted to wreak vengeance\" and allowing criminal proceedings to continue would result in patent injustice.A three-judge bench of justices Aniruddha Bose, Sanjay Kumar and SVN Bhatti said given the totality of facts and circumstances, it was of the considered opinion that the woman's allegations against her in-laws are wholly insufficient and, prima facie, do not make out a case against them.\"She clearly wanted to wreak vengeance against her in-laws... The allegations are so far-fetched and improbable that no prudent person can conclude that there are sufficient grounds to proceed against them ... Permitting the criminal process to go on against the appellants in such a situation would, therefore, result in clear and patent injustice,\" the supreme court said.The top court's judgment came on a plea against an order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court which refused to quash the proceedings against the woman's former brothers-in-law and mother-in-law.The woman, a teacher by profession, had married in the year 2007. The husband, however, secured a decree of divorce dissolving their marriage.Prior to the filing of the divorce petition by the husband, the woman made a written complaint to the police, levelling several allegations against her husband and in-laws.In response to the complaint, police filed an FIR against them under Indian Penal Code section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.The top court said the allegations levelled by the woman are mostly general and omnibus in nature, without any specific details as to how and when her brothers-in-law and mother-in-law, who lived in different cities altogether, subjected her to harassment for dowry.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIt said most damaging to the woman's case is the fact that she did nothing whatsoever after leaving her matrimonial home in February 2009, and filed a complaint in the year 2013 alleging dowry harassment, just before her husband instituted divorce proceedings.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "BJP MLA Virendra Raghuvanshi (extreme left) joined the Congress on Saturday.Bhopal:The run-up to the Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh is witnessing a string of leaders leaving the ruling BJP, with some of them joining the Congress. Many of the exits have been from the Gwalior-Chambal region, the home turf of several powerful BJP leaders, including Union ministers Jyotiraditya Scindia and Narendra Singh Tomar.Two key leaders have left the BJP in as many days this week. Both leaders have, directly or indirectly, blamed loyalists of Mr Scindia. The Union Minister responded by saying that people come and go during elections and, in a democracy, everyone has the right to make their own decisions.Two-time former MLA Girija Shankar Sharma, whose family has been associated with the BJP for decades, quit the party on Friday. Between him and his brother, Sitasaran Sharma, the family has won the Hoshangabad Assembly seat, which was earlier known as Itarsi, seven straight times since 1990.Accusing the BJP of ignoring veteran leaders and workers after new leaders joined the party, Mr Sharma said he would ensure that BJP candidates don't win from the seat, as the \"return of the present government isn't in the state's larger interest\".Mr Sharma's resignation came a day after sitting MLA from Kolaras seat of Shivpuri district, Virendra Raghuvanshi, quit the BJP, accusing leaders and ministers close to Mr Scindia of corruption as well as \"torture\" of people who have been with the party for a long time. Mr Raghuvanshi joined the Congress in the presence of the party's state president and former chief minister Kamal Nath on Saturday.Virendra Raghuvanshi was with the Congress when he was elected as an MLA for the first time in 2003. He joined the BJP in 2013 and was elected from Kolaras in 2018. He was also a member of the party's state executive.Addressing reporters on Thursday, Mr Raghuvanshi had said, \"Only god knows what pressure Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is in that he is unable to act against continued harassment and torture of old BJP workers and leaders by Team Scindia.\"\"I don't know why I'm being harassed and tortured within the BJP since Mr Scindia arrived with his loyalists three-and-a-half years ago. It is possibly happening because I worked for Jaibhan Singh Pawaiya and KP Yadav (both known to be part of the anti-Scindia camp in BJP) in the previous elections,\" he added.Jyotiraditya Scindia - who had joined the BJP with 22 MLAs in 2020, leading to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led Congress government - responded to the resignations by saying that people come and go during elections.\"In a democracy, everyone has the right to make their own decision. In 2020, the Congress government had made a promise against the farmers and young women. There was corruption in the 15-month government and six cabinet ministers resigned from the government at the same time. But, today, we are seeing that resignations are tendered two to four months before the elections,\" Mr Scindia said.According to sources, two BJP MLAs from the Vindhya region and one each from the Mahakaushal and Bundelkhand regions have kept their resignations ready.Former chief minister Kamal Nath said, \"Many leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party are in touch with me. Be it Scindia supporters or other leaders of the BJP, they will get entry into the Congress only if our local organisation agrees. Even Samandar Patel (Scindia loyalist who joined the Congress last month) came only with the consent of the local leaders.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIn the past 3 months, several BJP leaders have quit the party and joined the Congress. These include former minister Deepak Joshi, who is the son of former chief minister Kailash Joshi, former MLA Radhelal Baghel, former MLA Kunwar Dhruv Pratap Singh, Yadvendra Singh - son of former MLA Deshraj Singh - and Samandar Singh Patel.In April, former BJP MP from Khargone seat of west MP, Makhansingh Solanki, had resigned from the BJP and joined the Congress.

Aditya-L1 will neither land on the Sun nor approach it any closer, ISRO said.It is expected to travel for about 125 days to reach the Halo orbit around the Lagrangian Point L1, which is considered closest to the sun.Aditya-L1, weighing about 1,480.7 kg, is the first space-based observatory class to study the Sun.The objectives of the Aditya-L1 mission includes study of the coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, Coronal Mass Ejections (CME), dynamics of solar atmosphere and temperature anisotropy.Following Saturday's launch the Aditya-L1 stays in Earth-bound orbits for 16 days, during which it undergoes five maneuvers to gain the necessary velocity for its journey towards the Sun.Subsequently, the spacecraft undergoes a Trans-Lagrangian 1 insertion manoeuvre, marking the beginning of its 110-day trajectory to the destination around its destination.Upon arrival at the L1, another manoeuvre binds Aditya-L1 to an orbit around the point, which is a balanced gravitational location between the Earth and the Sun.The spacecraft spends its whole mission life of five years orbiting around L1 in an irregularly shaped orbit in a plane roughly perpendicular to the line joining the Earth and the Sun, ISRO said.The strategic placement at the L1 Lagrange point ensures the spacecraft can maintain a constant, uninterrupted view of the Sun. This location also allows the satellite to access solar radiation and magnetic storms before they are influenced by Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, the space agency informed.Additionally, the L1 point's gravitational stability minimises the need for frequent orbital maintenance efforts, optimising the spacecraft's operational efficiency.Aditya-L1 will stay approximately 1.5 million km away from the Earth, directed towards the Sun, which is about 1 per cent of the Earth-Sun distance.The PSLV C57 is the 59th flight of the launch vehicle, a trusted workhorses of ISRO and is the 25th mission using PSLV-XL configuration, ISRO said.The atmosphere of the Earth as well as its magnetic field act as protective shield and block harmful wavelength radiations. In order to detect such radiation, solar studies are carried out from space.Aditya-L1 mission carries seven scientific payloads to carry out the study.The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, which studies the solar corona and dynamics of Coronal Mass Ejections (CME), will be sending 1,440 images per day to the ground station for analysis on reaching the intended orbit.The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope payload images the Solar photosphere and Chromosphere in near Ultraviolet and also measures the solar irradiance variations.The Aditya Solar Wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX) and Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA) payloads study the solar wind and energetic ions as well as the energy distribution.The Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer and the High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS) study the X-ray flares from the Sun over a wide X-ray energy range.The Magnetometer payload is capable of measuring interplanetary magnetic fields at the L1 point.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe Science payloads of Aditya-L1 are indigenously developed with the close collaboration of various centers of ISRO.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "ISRO has readied a mission aimed at enhancing cutting-edge scientific understanding in Astronomy.Bengaluru:After the launch of Chandrayaan-3 Moon lander and Aditya-L1 ventures, ISRO has readied a mission aimed at enhancing cutting-edge scientific understanding in Astronomy.XPoSat (X-ray Polarimeter Satellite) is India's first dedicated polarimetry mission to study various dynamics of bright astronomical X-ray sources in extreme conditions.The spacecraft will carry two scientific payloads in a low earth orbit.The primary payload POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-rays) will measure the polarimetry parameters (degree and angle of polarization) in medium X-ray energy range of 8-30 keV photons of astronomical origin. The XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing) payload will give spectroscopic information in the energy range of 0.8-15 keV, according to ISRO.\"XPoSat is ready for launch,\" an official of the national space agency headquartered here said on Saturday. According to ISRO, the emission mechanism from various astronomical sources such as blackholes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, pulsar wind nebulae originates from complex physical processes and are challenging to understand.While the spectroscopic and timing information by various space-based observatories provide a wealth of information, the exact nature of the emission from such sources still poses deeper challenges to astronomers, ISRO officials say.\"The polarimetry measurements add two more dimensions to our understanding, the degree of polarisation and the angle of polarization and thus is an excellent diagnostic tool to understand the emission processes from astronomical sources,\" ISRO said.The polarimetric observations along with spectroscopic measurements are expected to break the degeneracy of various theoretical models of astronomical emission processes, the space agency said on the upcoming mission. This would be the major direction of research from XPoSat by the Indian science community.POLIX is an X-ray Polarimeter for astronomical observations in the energy band of 8-30 keV. The instrument is made of a collimator, a scatterer and four X-ray proportional counter detectors that surround the scatterer, which is made of low atomic mass material which causes anisotropic Thomson scattering of incoming polarised X-rays.The collimator restricts the field of view to 3 degree x 3 degree so as to have only one bright source in the field of view for most observations.POLIX is expected to observe about 40 bright astronomical sources of different categories during the planned lifetime of XPoSat mission of about five years. This is the first payload in the medium X-ray energy band dedicated for polarimetry measurements.XSPECT is an X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing payload onboard XPoSat, which can provide fast timing and good spectroscopic resolution in soft X-rays.Taking advantage of the long duration observations required by POLIX to measure X-ray polarization, XSPECT can provide long-term monitoring of spectral state changes in continuum emission, changes in their line flux and profile, and simultaneous long term temporal monitoring of soft X-ray emission in the X-ray energy range 0.8-15 keV.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comXSPECT would observe several types of sources - X-ray pulsars, blackhole binaries, low-magnetic field neutron star (NS) in LMXBs, AGNs and Magnetars.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

A few seconds later, the air-lit strap-on was successfully separated, and scientists watched the PSLV rocket head to space.Around 63 minutes after the launch, the Aditya-L1 was successfully separated from PSLV and injected into an elliptical orbit around the Earth. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief S Somanath declared the launch a success.ISRO in its latest update said, that Aditya-L1 has started to generate power and its solar panels have been deployed. The first EarthBound firing to raise its orbit is scheduled for tomorrow, September 3 at 11:45 am.Aditya-L1 will be placed in the halo orbit around Lagrange point 1 (L1) of the sun-Earth system, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth. The journey to L1 will take 125 days.Discovered by mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Lagrangian points are places in space where gravitational forces, acting between two objects, balance each other in such a way that spacecraft can remain in a fixed position with minimal fuel consumption.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe L1 point is considered the most significant of the Lagrangian points for solar observations.According to ISRO, the key objectives of the mission are understanding the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration; understanding the initiation of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), flares and near-Earth space weather; gaining knowledge of coupling and dynamics of the solar atmosphere; and getting a deeper understanding of solar wind distribution and temperature anisotropy (non-uniformity in different directions).",

The other minors also \"actively participated\" in the murder, the prosecution added.It was alleged that one of the minors wanted to take revenge as he was earlier beaten up by the victim who had also circulated a video of the incident.Allowing the appeal of the father of the victim against the JJB order, the sessions court said both minors understood the consequences of their action.It said the manner in which they committed the offence left no doubt that they deserved to be tried as adults.Both minors were involved previously in another murder case and the present offence had been committed in a pre-planned manner with proper strategy, Atma Ram said in his appeal.Both minors twisted their versions during assessment by the psychologist and introduced a false story regarding being drunk at the time of the incident, the appeal said.When the victim tried to escape on his motorcycle, the minors snatched his bike key and beat him again, leaving no scope for him to save his life, the court said.\"Considering the manner in which the alleged incident was committed is sufficient to show that CCLs had possessed the physical and mental capacity to commit the offence. They had executed their conspiracy to murder the victim in a perfectly planned manner,\" the court said.But they were \"remorseless and emotionally unconcerned\" for the victim and his family, it said.The court said the minors had concocted the story about them being drunk at the time of the incident.\"I am satisfied that they have introduced the story of their being drunk while committing offence, in order to save themselves from the rigours of being tried as adults as there is a drastic difference between trial and punishment in a heinous case between a person being tried as child vis-a-vis he being tried as adult,\" the judge said.ASJ Ms Attri noted various reports including the social background report, social investigation report, physical mental drug assessment report and preliminary assessment report.She said according to the reports both were aware of the consequences of their act but took the crime leniently or casually as one of the minors was let off after just four days of detention in the previous murder case. The other CCL was also let off quite soon.This emboldened them to commit the second murder and the minors were observed to be well aware of the JJB proceedings, including the maximum punishment awardable in heinous offence, the judge said.\"I am satisfied that both CCLs not only had the physical and mental capacity to commit the offence but also understood the near and far consequences of their action,\" the court said.\"Further, a detailed account of the manner in which the offence was committed leaves no doubt in mind to conclude that they deserve to be tried as adults. Accordingly, the present appeal is allowed,\" the court added.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

That I think is the principle of mediation apart from keeping the relationships intact,\" Justice Kaul said.He offered some reflections on the developments in legal education, emphasising the importance of using different methods of instruction such as case method, Socratic dialogue and incorporating experiential learning in the classroom, a release from NALSAR University of Law said.\"Socratic learning also teaches us something important about our political spaces. We live in exceedingly polarised times and we find daily instances of deeply disturbing political speeches. These absurd and provocative statements are made only because everyone is interested in defending the political positions to the hilt. But that is not the message of Socratic method or even of our Constitution,\" Justice Kaul said.He advised the graduating students to concentrate on learning from experienced mentors and to keep an open mind in public discussions.Justice Kaul specifically addressed the career paths that can be taken by law graduates such as litigation, judicial services, commercial law firms and academics among others, the release said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comSupreme Court judge Justice P S Narasimha, Telangana High Court Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and NALSAR Vice-Chancellor Prof. Srikrishna Deva Rao were among the dignitaries who were present at the convocation.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Uprooting Sanatana Dharma is upholding humanity and human equality. I stand firmly by every word I have spoken. I spoke on behalf of the oppressed and marginalized, who suffer due to the Sanatana Dharma,\" he said.Karti Chidambaram, Congress leader and former Home Minister P Chidambaram's son, has backed the remarks by Udhayanidhi Stalin, saying that Sanatana Dharma \"is nothing but code for a Caste Hierarchical Society\". \"All those batting for it are hankering for the Good Ole Days! Caste is the curse of India,\" he has said.Slamming DMK and the Congress over remarks by the two leaders, Mr Shah said, \"Over the past two days, they (INDIA) are insulting this country's heritage and Sanatana Dharma. Sons of top leaders of Congress and DMK are talking about finishing Sanatana Dharma for the politics of vote bank and appeasement.\"The Home Minister also referred to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's 2010 remark, in which he had said radical Hindu outfits are a bigger threat than terror organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba.\"Rahul Baba had said that Hindu organisations are more dangerous than Lashkar-e-Taiba. Rahul Baba, you compared Hindu organisations to Lashkar-e-Taiba and your Home Minister said there is 'Hindu terror' in the country,\" Mr Shah said.He was referring to former Home Minister and Congress leader Sushil Kumar Shinde's remark on Hindu terror. Mr Shinde has said he had used the expression at a Jaipur party meeting, but withdrew it immediately.At the Rajasthan rally, Mr Shah said Sanatana Dharma is ruling the hearts of people. \"They say Sanatana rule will come if Modi wins. Sanatana is ruling people's heart,\" he said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has underlined that India will run as per the Constitution.Accusing the Congress of blocking the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the Union Home Minister said, \"The Grand Ram temple will be ready in January at Lord Ram's birthplace.

It creates a much more predictable election cycle which allows the government to be better delivered. One nation, One Election is good for the people of India, Rajeev Chandrashekhar told ANI.If 'One Nation, One Election' does come into effect it could mean that elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies across India will be held simultaneously, with voting taking place at the same time. It is certainly bad for parties like Congress, for parties that prey on weak and vulnerable people who have no interest in a prosperous India. So I'm not surprised that the dynasty and the Gandhi family have called up Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and said don't join the committee, Mr Chandrashekhar added.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who was named a member of the High-Level Committee (HLC) constituted by the Centre on Saturday to examine One Nation, One Election' has declined to serve on the panel, saying its terms of reference have been prepared in a manner to guarantee its conclusions .He further accused Congress of doing everything to tear down the country and praised PM Modi's vision. Their party leader travels all around the world, tears down our democracy, talks about our judiciary, talks negative about our media, economy talks about everything to tear down our country... Congress will distract, lie, slam, and do everything that holds the country back.

In November 2020 while addressing a conference of presiding officers he said, One nation, one election is not only a subject of debate but a necessity for India. There is an election in India every month, which hampers development. Why should the country waste so much money?",

        "text": "Kota:Rocked by a spate of student suicides, the coaching hub of Kota is roping in wardens, mess workers and tiffin service providers to look for any signs of depression or stress among the students staying in hostels and PG accommodation.While the wardens are being encouraged to participate actively in the 'Darwaze pe dastak' (knock on door) campaign, the city police has urged the mess workers and tiffin providers to report if a student is repetitively absent from the mess and skipping meals or anyone's tiffin is found unconsumed.\"We have launched a campaign called 'Darwaze pe dastak' where we are encouraging wardens to make it a routine to knock on each students' door at around 11 pm, ask them if they are okay, notice their activities, and keep a vigil just to ensure that there are no signs of stress, depression or abnormal activity.\"After coaching, the students spend maximum time in hostels, and hence wardens should be the first one to notice the signs,\" Chandrasheel Thakur, ASP, Kota told PTI.Over 2.5 lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges.The year 2023 saw the highest number of student suicides -- 22 so far -- with two ending their lives in a gap of a few hours on August 27. Last year, the figure was 15.Packed schedule, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, burden of parents' expectations and homesickness are the common struggles of the students here.Psychologists have been warning that there are always signs that go undetected before any child takes the extreme step.\"The idea is to detect these early signs. If any student is repetitively missing classes or skipping meals, there has to be something. We want to identify these children, get them counselled before they get pushed to the brim. We have launched a dedicated number on which wardens, mess workers and tiffin providers can give us this information,\" he added.Naveen Mittal, president, Kota Hostel Association said there are 3,500 hostels and 25,000 paying guest (PG) accommodation in Kota.Garima Singh, warden, Amratingali Girls Residency said she knocks on the doors of children regularly. The idea is not to disturb them, but to keep a check if they are fine. If someone is sleeping for unusual hours, I discuss with them if they are just tired or unwell. I check their mess logbooks too. If someone has not eaten meals in the mess, I ask if he or she did not like the food or is it because of some stress, she said.The district administration recently directed the coaching institutes to stop conducting routine tests for students preparing for NEET and other competitive exams for the next two months in the wake of the latest suicides.Gagendra Soni, warden of a boys hostel said, Some boys opt for tiffin service rather than mess food. We notice sometimes that the tiffin is lying outside the room. We take it very seriously now and try to strike a conversation.\" In a desperate move, the authorities had recently ordered hostels to install a spring device on ceiling fans to stop students from taking their lives.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

It is a democratic exercise,\" Mr Thakur said. He said the \"one nation, one nation\" committee has members of the Opposition too so that they can give their views.\"But they have left. They don't believe in discussions. They only make noise on the streets, just make allegations and run away. Remember how many days of the monsoon session (of parliament) they had wasted?\" Mr Thakur said.He said the Opposition made similar allegations when the government was working to bring the goods and services tax (GST) regime, a kind of \"one nation, one tax\".\"Earlier, collecting Rs 90,000 crore was a difficult task. Today, we collect Rs 1.60 lakh crore. This money has been used on developing infrastructure, building homes and toilets for the poor, free vaccines, new airports, new medical colleges, more AIIMS...\" the Union Minister said.The leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has declined to be part of the eight-member committee.In a letter to Home Minister Amit Shah, who is also part of the committee, Mr Chowdhury pointed out that Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge \"has been excluded\" from the committee, and instead they took former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.\"This is a deliberate insult to the system of parliamentary democracy,\" Mr Chowdhury said in the letter.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi today said the idea of 'one nation, one election' is an attack on the Indian Union and all its states.The nine-member committee will check whether the amendments to the Constitution would need ratification by the states, according to the government's gazette notification today.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe committee will analyse and recommend possible solutions linked to simultaneous elections if there is a hung house, no-confidence motion, defection, or any such other event.A single electoral roll and identity card for voters valid for the national, state, civic body and panchayat elections will be explored, the government said in the notification.",

(File)Bhiwani/Chandigarh:Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday rejected the 'One nation, One election' concept, asking what will the common man get from such an arrangement.In Bhiwani, Mr Kejriwal also launched a counter attack on the BJP on another issue, a day after Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said many parties offer freebies to the public.The AAP national convener asked if giving quality and free education to the poor, building good hospitals for the poor and giving free treatment to them was any sin or a crime.With Haryana going to polls next year, Arvind Kejriwal, who was addressing a gathering at a party event in Bhiwani, said there is an undercurrent in AAP's favour as people of the state are looking for a \"badlaav\" (change).\"...Aur dheere dheere iska BJP ka safaya dekhna ek din Aam Aadmi Party hi karegi iss desh k andar (And one day it will be the AAP which will wipe out the BJP from this country),\" Mr Kejriwal said.He took on the BJP on the 'one nation, one election' idea, saying rather there should be one nation-one education, where rich or poor all get good education.\"What will the common man get from 'one nation, one election'?\" he said.\"Since yesterday, the BJP is talking about this,\" he said.\"One nation, one election. What will we get out of it? Whether a common man will get anything from one nation, one election, one nation, 100 elections, one nation, 1,000 elections, what will we get.

You keep it with you,\" he told the BJP.The Centre on Saturday notified an eight-member high-level committee to examine and make recommendations at the earliest on the issue of holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha, state assemblies, municipalities and panchayats.Arvind Kejriwal, who was accompanied by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and other party leaders for a party programme, while targeting the BJP government in Haryana, said corruption is rampant, they did not undertake any development. \"They did not build any schools, hospitals or roads,\" he said.\"Khattar sahab said one party comes and says it will give this and that free,\" he said, making a reference to the Haryana chief minister's remarks.A day earlier, Haryana Chief Minister Khattar, without naming anyone, had said many parties offer freebies while the BJP government prioritizes skill development and training for individuals, along with providing necessary capital and grants when needed.\"I want to ask you (the gathering) if we give good and free education to the poor children of this country, do we commit any sin.

And then they say we are giving freebies,\" he said.We don't indulge in corruption like them and commit sin, he said.Arvind Kejriwal was in Bhiwani for the oath-taking event of nearly 4,000 office bearers of the party which included state, district and party's circle level office bearers.People are connecting with the AAP with each passing day, said Kejriwal, while adding people are fed up with other parties and the incumbent regime and they want \"badlaav\".On his party's expanding base in Haryana, he said by October 31, on every booth, booth committees will be set up. There are nearly 20,000 booths in Haryana and two lakh AAP office bearers, with 10 people for every committee, will be in place.Ninety per cent workers are those who are common people of Haryana including farmers and traders, he said referring to the AAP.Taking on other parties, he said, had these people done their job properly, \"why would we have entered politics\".\"Name any single party in the country which says we will establish schools for your children and give us vote.

He cannot say this because he did not do any work.\" He also hit out at the Centre, accusing it of indulging in corruption and \"working only for one person\".\"They need vote of 140 crore people but 'one nation, one dost',\" he said.Attacking the Prime Minister, Kejriwal said, \"Are you working for the country or for only one person.\" Apparently attacking the BJP-led Centre, Mr Kejriwal said they tried hard to stop from carrying out works in Delhi, despite this, they did so much work and people voted them to power for third time.\"If any research is conducted over this, then perhaps I will get a Nobel prize for doing so many works despite having been stopped from doing so,\" he said.He also told the party workers at the gathering that they should not come to AAP with the thinking that they will get posts or positions, but serving the country should be their sole motto.\"Today, Manish Sisodia is in jail, it has been six months.

Since it was 7 pm, I was getting ready to leave. He hugged and kissed me on my face, holding me close to him. I froze and pulled myself away. I complained to the higher officials the next day.

I was in the middle of my internship and didn't make any further complaints as he was a senior official and had the power to sabotage my internship certification process. I was scared,\" she wrote.The senior doctor was recently transferred to another hospital, and no strict action was taken against him other than stalling his promotion, she said, adding that it took her years to talk about this openly.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"I want to expose the predator and make sure everyone knows about his antics.

Mitali Roy won from Dhupguri in 2016, but lost to BJP's Bishnupada Roy in 2021. The BJP leader's death last month led to the assembly bypoll next Tuesday.Ms Roy is seen as an influential leader locally and the BJP termed her defection as a big blow to the Trinamool.\"Within 24 hours of @abhishekaitc's public meeting, Mitali Roy, former MLA of Dhupguri assembly, left Trinamool and joined BJP today at Dhupguri election office...! The end of Trinamool has begun!! Long live BJP,\" said West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar.West Bengal minister Shashi Panja retorted with a \"washing machine\" jibe at the BJP, an allegation often made by non-BJP parties to symbolise that every corrupt person comes out clean after joining the BJP.\"@BJP4Bengal's Washing Machine politics continues! Foes of 2021 becoming Friends in 2023 displays nothing but political opportunism!

However, Trinamool claims it has been able to regain some lost ground in the region and hopes to wrest the seat from the BJP.The bypoll will primarily be a Trinamool vs BJP fight. The Left has fielded a candidate supported by the Congress, an indicator of the tricky issue of seat-sharing for the INDIA alliance in West Bengal.Trimamool has fielded college professor Nirmal Chandra Roy for the bypoll and the BJP has nominated Tapasi Roy, the widow of a central police force personnel killed in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in 2021.

There are lots of religions in the world and any such comment on any religion is personal, everybody has the freedom. 'Sanatana Dharma' is an established way of life and a religious expression. It should be respected completely,\" he said.Meanwhile, a Supreme Court lawyer on Sunday filed a complaint with Delhi Police against Udhayanidhi Stalin over his controversial statement.Complainant Vineet Jindal, a practising lawyer, has claimed that Udhayanidhi in a speech made a provocative, inflammatory, derogatory, and inciting statement against Sanatan Dharam.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comBy using words like \"eradication of Santana dharma' and comparing Dharma to Mosquitoes, dengue, corona, and malaria and saying that \"these things which we cannot oppose, we have to eradicate them.

        "title": "Hyderabad Firm Unveils India's First AI-Powered Anti-Drone System",
        "text": "This is the first time such a system has been developed in India.Hyderabad:A Hyderabad-based robotics firm has unveiled a state-of-the-art autonomous anti-drone system, powered by artificial intelligence. The system can protect not just vital installations like nuclear installations and oil rigs, but also a wide area encompassing even an entire city, from multiple drones of any kind. This is the first time such a system has been developed in India.This advanced full-spectrum drone security system capability was demonstrated live on the outskirts of Hyderabad by Grene Robotics, a deep-tech company that specialises in providing AI-powered security solutions for defence, enterprise, and government sectors.Named Indrajaal, it is said to be the world's only wide-area Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS). It can provide a comprehensive and integrated security mechanism against moving threats that cannot be tackled with static defence systems.Uttarakhand Governor Lieutenant General Gurmit Singh, who served as the Deputy Chief of Army Staff from 2014 to 2016, sees Indrajaal as a futuristic solution to India's security challenges in the defence, public infrastructure, and private sectors.\"We will never forget the June 27, 2021 drone attack on the Jammu airport and the June 15 Galwan attack. At that time, we wondered what solution we had against drones and swarms. Today, Indrajaal has given us the answer and shown that it is possible.\"Kiran Raju, the founder of Grene Robotics, which was established 12 years ago, says that Indrajaal's design uses a LEGO-like combination mechanism that offers 12 unique layers of technology powered by artificial intelligence.\"The system provides 360-degree protection, with the ability to detect, identify, classify, track, and neutralise threats in real time. The threat lifetime can be as short as 30 seconds to a few minutes,\" Mr Raju said.Indrajaal is designed to defend against all classes and levels of autonomous drones over an area of 4,000 square kilometres.\"From low radar cross section (RCS) threats to medium and high-altitude long endurance (MALE and HALE) UAVs, loitering munitions, smart bombs, rocket showers, nano and micro drones, swarm drones, and more, we have it all covered,\" said Wing Commander Sai Mallela, co-founder of Grene Robotics. He had earlier helped develop the Integrated Air Command and Control System for the Indian Air Force, to adopt network-based operations, and also helped orchestrate a multi-million dollar import substitution for the forces.Lt Col Gurmit Singh, who has headed units that overlooked the Line of Control in Kashmir and has also worked in border issues and counter-terrorism, points out that India has seen a significant increase in hostile UAV activity in the past couple of years. This includes attempts to drop weapons, money, and narcotics across the border into Jammu and Punjab regions, as well as missions to surveil Indian security forces.In 2020, there were 76 reported cases of hostile UAV activity in India. This number increased to 109 in 2021 and 266 in 2022. In the first 8 months of 2023, there have already been 200 reported cases, drawing attention to the need for heightened vigilance and counter-measures to safeguard national security.Mr Raju says that in the near future, we will see a lot of drone activity, and 95% of them will be friendly drones rather than threats. \"Indrajaal can identify friendly drones from foes.\"On the cost, Mr Raju says, \"If I am building the Telangana secretariat for Rs 200-300 crore, this system would cost about Rs 5 crore. This is a typical capital infrastructure cost to protect what you are building. For example, level 4 data centres have fire protection, and they also need drone protection as part of their capital infrastructure.\"Wing Commander Sai Mallela explains that current deployments have limitations, as stand-alone systems are not scalable or practical. \"Only radar-based detections are inaccurate at low radar cross section (RCS) and close to the ground. They are even incapable of identifying the operating radio frequency.\"Besides, jamming can only delay an attack, not stop it. Laser weapons require a large, non-moving target, and there is no countermeasure to mitigate a swarm attack. Existing point defence-based anti-UAV systems rely on physical sighting, but drones are a moving target.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe makers of Indrajaal are confident that their system can protect large defence bases, areas like the National Capital Region (NCR) that has several critical buildings, international borders, and prevent attacks during VIP movement or huge crowds, against UAVs, low radar cross-section (RCS) missiles, smart munitions, and even swarm drones.\"A simple refinery oil field could be spread over 300-400 square kilometres. The uniqueness of this system is that it can be deployed as a single system over that entire area, ensuring no conflict of command and control, because there is a single decision center. This is a huge benefit in terms of operation, command and control, and costs. We are heavily indigenous, which is a significant step in itself,\" says Wing Commander Sai Mallela.",

        "title": "Political Stability Under PM Modi Putting Rocket Fuel Into New India: Report",
        "text": "The author points out that India's rising influence can be seen in other spheres, too.New Delhi:United Kingdom's Telegraph newspaper in a recent article stated that India which was mired by fractious politics has undergone great political stability under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has allowed for legal reforms, improvements to basic welfare systems, and a vast upgrading of the country's infrastructure.In his September 2 article in the newsdaily, author Ben Wright writes that India holds potential and also some problems, but under the leadership of PM Modi, India definitely holds the bold targets, it aims to achieve.The author has pointed out that with the success of Chandrayaan-3, India became only the fourth (and third extant) country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, following the US, the Soviet Union, and China.The fact that Russia's attempt to land in the same previously unexplored region had ended in ignominious failure a few days earlier further accentuated the achievement, which, rather deliciously, coincided with the BRICS international relations summit in Johannesburg.India's successful lunar mission was met by wild celebrations across the subcontinent and was hailed as another one of the many straws in the wind, illustrating the country's ascendancy, according to Ray Dalio, a billionaire News Sport Business Opinion Ukraine Money Royals Life Style Travel Culture Puzzles 11 1 hedge fund manager, The Telegraph reported.Notably, India's population recently overtook that of China's: the International Monetary Fund's forecast that it will be one of the fastest-growing large economies in 2023 and for the next five years; the sheer acreage of red carpet rolled out in foreign capitals around the world to welcome Narendra Modi, the prime minister; and Air India's recent world record order of 470 planes from Airbus and Boeing.Opening his company's first retail outlets in Mumbai and Delhi in May, Tim Cook, the Apple boss, declared India was at a tipping point . Over the summer, a unit of Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant that makes iPhones, started drawing up plans to build a USD 1 billion factory in the southern state of Karnataka; the US-based Micron Technology announced it will start building a new semi-conductor facility in Gujarat later this year; and Goldman Sachs held its first board meeting in India in more than a decade, The Telegraph reported.The author further points out that the country's rising influence can be seen in other spheres, too.Cricket's Indian Premier League is now the second most valuable sports league in the world, behind just American football's National Football League, with offshoots in an increasing number of countries.The newly-released Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first US blockbuster to feature an Indian superhero. In the film, which played to packed cinemas across India over the summer, Pavitr Prabhakar (whose name is a play on Peter Parker) admonishes another character when he asks for chai tea : Chai' means tea, bro! You're saying tea tea!' Call it cultural reappropriation, perhaps, The Telegraph reported.According to the author, India also appears to be benefiting from the convergence of several economic mega-trends.On current estimates, it will be the world's third largest economy in four years' time; its working-age population will exceed China's by an astounding 235 million (roughly the population of Pakistan) in seven years; and its gross domestic product will more than double to USD 8.5 trillion (2.78 trillion Euros) in 10.As globalisation has seemingly gone into reverse following the Covid pandemic and as international frictions intensify, India should be well-positioned to profit from a boom in friend-shoring , The Telegraph reported.US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen was in India earlier this year talking up the idea. Western companies want access to India's burgeoning middle class, and Western politicians have a vested interest in helping boost a second centre of economic gravity to compete with China in the region.The author further pointed out that the world's biggest democracy with over 600 parties has historically been bedevilled by fractious politics. However, under PM Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party has won consecutive parliamentary majorities and looks on course to make it a hat trick next May.Coupled with the marked decline of the Congress Party, this has provided a measure of political stability that has allowed for legal reforms, improvements to basic welfare systems and a vast upgrading of the country's infrastructure, according to the Telegraph report.However, the report also warns that the clock is ticking. Economists say the demographic stars align just once in the lifetime of any given nation. India currently accounts for one in every four people of working age in the entire world but its elderly population is forecast to increase by 40 per cent in the coming decade. The economy must maximise growth while its demographic boom is peaking or it will, in the words of Samiran Chakraborty, chief India economist at Citigroup investment bank, get old before it gets rich .The economy's heavy reliance on the services industry means the country is struggling to generate enough jobs to employ India's youth. Education standards are well below par and malnutrition is stubbornly high. The top 1 per cent and top 10 per cent in India capture 22 per cent and 57 per cent of income (the 3rd and 4th highest share across major countries). And there are signs that economic anxiety appears to be breeding a generation of angry youngsters and creating toxic identity politics, The Telegraph reported.Unsurprisingly, PM Modi has been emphasising the positive aspect when he riffed at length on the theme of India's demographic dividend during his Independence Day speech last month. The prime minister noted that, while other countries are ageing fast, the average India is just 28, adding: My country has crores [tens of millions] of hands, crores of brains, crores of dreams, crores of resolutions! That all adds up to crores of consumers. Few people have a better idea of what they are up to than Gautam Singhania. One of the country's ever-expanding cadre of billionaires, he runs the Raymond Group, a conglomerate that has, in common with many successful Indian businesses, branched off into a variety of different areas, including real estate, auto services and, until he recently sold off a men's consumer care unit, Kamasutra-branded condoms.But the company was built on the back of its clothing and fabric brands, which sells material for as little as 300 rupees ( 3) a metre up to as much as 2 million rupees a metre. This gives Singhania an extraordinary overview of the spending habits of every strata of Indian society. Indians are getting richer and trading up; every sector is growing because consumption is booming, says Singhania. India is on a trajectory that will be hard to shake. It's a juggernaut, The Telegraph quoted him as saying.The report highlights how in Mumbai, the traffic situation is very poor. The city is a building site with four massive infrastructure projects. The new Coastal Road, which will run along the west side of the city, connecting Marine Lines in the south to Kandivali in the north, will act as a kind of bypass for the peninsula.The Trans-Harbour link, which when completed will include the longest sea bridge in India, will link Mumbai to Navi Mumbai across Thane Creek. Then there is the Metro, one line of which when opened next year is expected to carry 1.7 million passengers a day and take the pressure off the city's overcrowded suburban rail network. A new airport is also being built in Navi Mumbai, The Telegraph reported.In addition, there's already a medium-high-speed Vande Bharat Express linking Mumbai to Ahmedabad in Gujarat, and a bullet train line following the same route is under construction.This will cut journey times from more than five hours to just over two hours. The eight-lane (12-lane in some places) Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is due to be completed by June 2024 (just before the election), reducing driving time between India's two main cities from 24 to 12 hours. But, while the size and growth rate of India's economy certainly hold the promise of great potential, they can't hide the fact that the country remains desperately poor. Mumbai is home to both helipad-topped palaces but also Dharavi, the world's biggest slum, the Telegraph report added.Meanwhile, PM Modi recently guaranteed that India will be the third largest economy in the world by the end of what would be his third term if he wins next year's election. That's a fairly realistic goal. India has a nominal GDP of USD 3.7 trillion and only needs to leapfrog Germany on USD 4.2 trillion and Japan on USD 4.4 trillion countries that appear to be going nowhere fast by 2029.But the prime minister also wants India to become a developed country by 2047, the year in which it celebrates its centenary. The author believes that this is an extremely bold ambition.Annual per capita income will have to rise from USD 2,601 today to USD 21,664 according to IMF figures. The Reserve Bank of India has calculated this will require the economy to grow by at least 7.6 per cent a year, every year for the next quarter of a century a feat that has been achieved only seven times since the economic reforms of 1991 and never for more than two consecutive years, The Telegraph reported.Amitabh Kant, one of India's top bureaucrats (sometimes labelled supercrats ) who masterminded the government's Made in India' campaign and digitisation drive, points out that nearly half of the economy's growth is driven by the services sector. He admits that achieving Modi's ambition of lifting the whole population above the poverty line will require the country to fire on all cylinders .This means enhancing the productivity of the agricultural sector, building denser urban centres on the back of better transportation infrastructure, bolstering the country's chronically underperforming manufacturing sector and turbo-charging the services sector on the back of smart digitisation.According to The Telegraph, India has a mixed track record in these four areas. The biggest grounds for disappointment have been attempts to reform the agricultural sector, on which around two-thirds of the population still depends.As per the author, India's unprecedented drive to digitise its economy that arguably holds out most promise. QR codes adorn the most lowly food stalls. Everyone with a phone, which is the majority of the population, can make and take payments at the tap of a button.At the heart of this effort is the India Stack government-backed APIs, or application programming interfaces, upon which third parties can build software with access to government IDs and payment networks, The Telegraph reported. We wanted to create something that is relevant to India rather than copy and pasting solutions from other countries, says Ritesh Shukla, the chief executive of NPCI International Payments, which built and operates the country's unified payments system.He further argues that India's real-time digital payments have made the country's welfare system more efficient, have reduced corruption and should ease the migration to India's cities by making it easier for people to earn a living where they already are. In time they could also make it cheaper for India's vast diaspora to send money home.Innovative fintechs like Paytm have already started offering small loans to micro-business on the back of their transactions histories providing credit to whole swathes of the population that until recently didn't even have bank accounts.According to The Telegraph, much of PM Modi's first term was focussed on rolling out welfare schemes such as ensuring the whole country had bank accounts into which benefits could be paid, subsidised cooking gas and the government-funded construction of lavatories. His second term has been notable for a genuinely pro-business agenda. He made a point of praising wealth creators and budgeted 2 trillion rupees for production-linked incentives designed to boost the country's capabilities in manufacturing sectors including pharmaceuticals, mobile phones and cars.A once highly inefficient, cash-based economy is being dragged into the 21st century at lightning speed. India's prime minister has cut corporation tax from 35 per cent to 25 per cent and opened up the country to more foreign investment. The adoption of a nationwide goods-and-services tax has replaced a bewildering array of local levies, The Telegraph reported.The government has also pledged to privatise the country's flat-footed state-owned banks and managed to sell off Air India, something that many feared would be unachievable.However, Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, worries that India's high levels of unemployment could lead to it squandering its moment in the sun and feels the country needs to invest more in human capital meaning education, skills and health.Mr Rajan also cautions against being swayed by the periodic swings between pessimism and optimism about India. We treat our economy a bit like we treat our cricket team it's either the best thing in the world or the worst, he says.The reality for both the country's economic potential and sporting prowess lies somewhere between the two extremes. India certainly has a habit of confounding the naysayers. As Ramachandra Guha, the historian, points out, many obituaries were written for the young nation in the years after independence. The pessimists reckoned India too much of hodge-podge split along lines of caste, class, language and religion to persist as a nation, and much too poor to endure as a democracy, The Telegraph reported.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, adds a touch of nuance to Modi's sloganeering. He sums up the prime minister's 2047 goal as a message to the nation saying we need to pull up our socks and do something very determined and focused over the next 25 years so that... it is within the realm of possibility that we will become a developed nation .He adds: We think we've done a good job in the last decade, but we are very conscious of the fact that a lot of what we have to do lies ahead of us. PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com Few countries are as simultaneously replete with both problems and promise as PM Modi's. Then again, few countries are more used to dealing with their own internal contradictions. India's rise is certainly not inevitable. However, you wouldn't want to bet against it either, Ben Wright stated in The Telegraph.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Villagers claimed that police also fired some rounds in the air, but officials did not confirm it.Cases have been registered against more than 350 people for their alleged involvement in the violence, officials said.Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is also the state Home Minister, today called Manoj Jarange discussion on the matter and assured him that action will be taken against those responsible for the \"unfortunate incident\" in Jalna.Mr Shinde said the state government was committed to provide reservation to the Maratha community. \"The state government is taking some steps to give reservation to the community. During Devendra Fadnavis's tenure as chief minister, the state government had given reservation to the Maratha community but the Supreme Court quashed it,\" he said.Protesters yesterday had gathered at Mumbai's iconic Marine Drive and also outside the Plaza Cinema in Dadar demanding reservation for the politically dominant Maratha community.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comShiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar slammed the \"government brutality\" of police lathi-charging the protestors and demanded the resignation of Devendra Fadnavis.The two leaders also visited the violence-hit village on Saturday. \"We met the injured at the hospital.

(file)Chennai:The Bharatiya Janata Party today slammed Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK president MK Stalin for attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the first episode ofhis podcast series. PM Modi never promised Rs 15 lakh would be deposited in everyone's account, the party said, adding that claims in the podcast are \"lies\".In the podcast episode that was released in four different languages -- Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi -- this morning, Mr Stalin claimed the BJP didn't fulfil any pre-poll promise regarding social welfare in its last nine years at the Center.Rs 15 lakh each were not deposited in all citizens' accounts as promised, farmers' incomes didn't double, two crore jobs per year were promised but didn't happen, the Chief Minister said in an all-out attack on the BJP-led Centre.The INDIA alliance must win to prevent the whole of India from becoming Manipur and Haryana, Mr Stalin said, referring to large-scale ethnic violence in the north-eastern state since May this year, and the recent communal violence in Haryana after a religious procession was attacked.MK Stalin further called upon the people to \"carve out a multicultural and diverse India\", alleging that the BJP resorts to communalism to cover up issues like public sector undertakings \"being dismantled and handed over to friendly corporations\", Air India being sold to a private player, and airports and seaports \"handed over to corporations that are close to the BJP\".The DMK chief also referred to the 2002 Gujarat riots, saying the \"hatred sown in Gujarat in 2002\" has resulted in sectarian violence in Manipur and communal clashes in Haryana in 2023.The India alliance was formed to restore social justice, social harmony, federalism, secular politics and socialism, Mr Stalin said, and issued a grim warning that \"nobody can save India if this is not stopped now\".\"DMK has always been at the forefront whenever there's a threat to federalism,\" MK Stalin said.The BJP has hit back, saying it the DMK that divides the country on religion, caste, and language.Refuting any attack on federalism, Tamil Nadu BJP Vice President Narayanan Tirupati claimed the Centre has given due share of tax revenue to Tamil Nadu.In a jibe at the DMK, he said he is \"glad that at least now MK Stalin accepts India as one nation\".The podcast, named \"Speaking for India\", was started to highlight what MK Stalin calls the \"destruction of India under BJP\".He said the podcast would also promote the vision of an \"egalitarian and harmonious India\" that the opposition alliance aspires to build.MK Stalin's podcast debut marks a pivotal moment in his political communication strategy, setting the stage for a larger role in national politics, particularly in steering and shaping the INDIA alliance.

The EGI president has also been mentioned as an accused in the FIR.The FIR states the EGI report captioned the photo of a burning building in Churachandpur district as a \"Kuki house\".The Manipur forest department's beat office in Churachandpur district that was set on fire on May 3 was shown as a \"Kuki house\" in the Editors' Guild of India (EGI) report. The EGI said it has corrected the error and will publish a fresh report.The building, however, was a Forest Department beat office that was set on fire by a mob on May 3, the day large-scale violence broke out in the district, 65 km from the state capital Imphal, following a protest by the hill-majority Kuki tribes against the valley-majority Meiteis over the Meiteis' demand for Scheduled Tribes (ST) status.An FIR filed on May 3 evening by a policeman, sub-inspector Jangkholal Kipgen, said \"a large number of angry crowd\" damaged the Forest Department beat office with \"fire or explosive substances\".The EGI yesterday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, accepted the error in its report and said it is \"being rectified and an updated report will be uploaded shortly.\" \"...

The EGI in the report faulted the state government for taking a series of steps that led to resentment among the Chin-Kukis to build up. \"The state government seems to have facilitated the majority's anger against the Kukis through several seemingly partisan statements and policy measures,\" the report said.The social worker in the FIR, however, alleged the EGI report has not mentioned key facts about large-scale illegal immigration to Manipur that threatens the indigenous people with a demographic change.\"The abnormal population growth in Manipur is also evident from the fact that the Census of 2001 has not been finalised for the nine hills subdivision of the state due to the abnormal decadal growth of the population up to 169 per cent,\" N Sarat Singh said in the FIR.\"Recently, the Election Commission of India identified 1,33,553 photo similar entries in Manipur's electoral roll,\" he said, adding steps are being taken to delete duplicate voters. \"... It is very alarming, and it proves the fact that there are various unaccounted population existing in Manipur having illegally come from neighbouring countries including Myanmar,\" the social worker said in the FIR.Funds For Hill AreasThe complainant took strong exception to the allegation in the EGI report that only 10 per cent of the state's funds go towards development of hill areas.\"That it is also completely false for the accused to deliberately state that only about 10 per cent of the funds (go) for development of hill areas. Whereas the true fact as per the finding of the committee of officers is that about 40 per cent of the developmental funds of the state is invested in the hill areas of the state,\" the social worker said in the FIR, which includes the findings of the committee that were presented to the state assembly in 2021.State Government had stated on the floor of the Assembly in 2021 regarding the budget allocation for the Valley and Hills across all departmental works.

This, the EGI team was told, was because they did not want to inflame the already volatile situation further... However, the downside of such an approach during ethnic violence is that it can easily slip into forging a common ethnic narrative and lead to a collective downslide of journalistic principles by deciding what to report and what to censor,\" the EGI report said in its concluding remarks.\"Wrong Representations\": Manipur MediaResponding to the allegation, the All Manipur Working Journalists Union, and the Editors' Guild of Manipur said they have taken strong exception to the \"half-baked so-called fact-finding report, which was completed in merely four days.\"\"The report has many contentions and wrong representations which are damaging to the reputation of the journalist community in the state, especially Imphal-based news outlets,\" the Manipur journalists' collective and the Editors' Guild of Manipur said in the statement.The three journalists came to Manipur on a crowdfunded visit to prepare the report.

So I think that message will resonate long after the G20. The message that this is an era for responsible countries to show responsible rule of law...that will also resonate way beyond the G20 presidency of India,\" Mr Chandrasekhar pointed out.India has highlighted that power of technology, innovation, and bright, young minds all around the world will shape the global future.\"So I think India's presidency will certainly give a lot of permanent messages and learnings to the countries of the world beyond the G20 presidency, and it will certainly be one of the more defining Presidencies of the G20 in the recent years,\" he said.While the world went through two 'black swan events' over last 3-4 years, India has emerged as a \"bright spot\" with its economy expanding and \"chugging at full speed\", Mr Chandrasekhar noted.\"We hope that global recovery stabilises, that the US and other Western economies that are today slowing down or showing signs of weakness get back, because in a lot of way these are consumption markets...Currently India is a bright spot in the world...but we would also like the rest of the world to pick up and shrug off whatever problems...and get back to building an economy, global trade, economic growth, that is fair, sustained, equitable and allows many of small countries that have, in a sense, not been able to participate in economic growth also to participate,\" he said.Asked if he is confident about a Joint Communique or 'Leaders Declaration' being agreed on at the G20 Summit in India given the divergent views and differences (deadlock over the Ukraine war) that are emerging, the minister declined to make specific observations.\"I certainly don't want to venture an opinion on that...but I can tell you from my interactions, that the Indian message and India's view of the future of our world, as espoused beautifully by our Prime Minister is gaining a lot of traction and India as a statesman on the world stage, its position has been sealed by this presidency of the G20,\" he said.India, the minister said, has demonstrated responsible presidency, placing world interest ahead of any self interest.\"And I think this is an example of responsible conduct that all big countries must espouse to...some countries practice it, some countries don't. Those who practice it are the ones that are being respected by the world, in the future. Those who don't practice it are the ones who will not be,\" he said.Mr Chandrasekhar said the Indian presidency of G20 has \"certainly left a very indelible mark in many, many ways\".Citing theVasudhaiva Kutumbakam(One Earth-One Family-One Future) slogan, Mr Chandrasekhar said the world is now recognising the need for more sustainability, with conversations revolving around the ways for nations and people to move towards shared future and prosperity.Alongside this, India's thrust on DPIs, the one Future Alliance, innovation, and young minds have been deeply appreciated by countries of the Global South, that long felt a gap in digitisation and technology.\"India putting forth this narrative about DPI, has seen a great deal of resonance, especially among those countries of the Global South, who have long felt that digitisation and technology were only for the rich countries,\" Mr Chandrasekhar said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIndia, through its DPIs and one Future Alliance, has demonstrated that there is a reasonable and realistic opportunity for every country, big or small, to also embrace a powerful digitisation journey, he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "A committee led by Ram Nath Kovind has been tasked with exploring simultaneous polls in India.Weeks before \"One Nation, One Election\" got a fresh thrust with the government asking a panel to examine the proposal, Union Law Minister Arjun Meghwal had listed the big hurdles and imperatives for syncing elections nationwide.Arjun Meghwal had cited five impediments to \"One Nation, One Election\" and arguments in favour of the idea in a written reply in parliament on 27 July, to a question raised by Kirodi Lal Meena.Hurdles Listed by Minister:The move would require amendments in five articles of the Constitution, the Law Minister said.These are, Article 83 on the duration of Houses of Parliament, Article 85 on the dissolution of Lok Sabha by the President, Article 172 on the duration of state legislatures, Article 174 on dissolving state legislatures and Article 356 on President's Rule in states.Simultaneous national and general elections will also require the consensus of all political parties.Mr Meghwal said given the country's federal structure, it was imperative that the consensus of all state governments was obtained.The cost of the move could run into thousands of crores as additional Electronic Voting Machines and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (EVMs/VVPATs) would be needed.\"Considering that the life of the (EVM) machine is only 15 years, this would imply that the machine would be used for about three or four times in its life span, entailing huge expenditure in its replacement every 15 years,\" said Mr Meghwal's reply.The minister also listed the requirement of additional polling personnel and security forces.Pros listed by Law Minister:Simultaneous elections will be a huge saving for the public exchequer. The minister says avoiding replicating the administrative and law and order machinery with repeated elections will also save the costs to political parties and candidates in their election campaigns.Because of asynchronous national and state elections, including byelections, the Model Code of Conduct is in force for prolonged periods, which impacts developmental and welfare programmes adversely.The minister cited the example of South Africa, where elections to national and provincial legislatures are held simultaneously for five years and municipal elections are held two years later.In Sweden, the election to the national legislature (Riksdag) and provincial legislature/county council (Landsting) and local bodies/municipal assemblies (Kommunfullmaktige) are held on a fixed date - the second Sunday of September - for four years.In UK, the term of parliament is governed by the Fixed-term Parliament Act, 2011.A committee led by former president Ram Nath Kovind has been tasked with exploring simultaneous polls in India, which was the norm till the 1960s. India voted simultaneously for the Centre and states in 1952, 1957, 1962 and 1967.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe idea to revert to simultaneous polls was suggested in the annual report of the Election Commission in 1983. Later, a Law Commission report referred to it in 1999.In 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP-led government came to power, the party made a strong pitch for \"one nation, one election\".",

Voting for the bypoll will be held from 7 am to 6 pm, and counting of votes will be held on September 8.Besides the Congress and the Left parties, Singh also has the support of INDIA bloc members Aam Aadmi Party, the CPI(ML)-Liberation and the Suheldev Swabhiman Party (SSP) -- a splinter group of the SBSP.Those who canvassed for Mr Chauhan included Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Brajesh Pathak and leaders of BJP-led NDA members. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav were among the main campaigners for Singh.In all, there are 10 candidates in the fray for the Ghosi assembly seat in Mau district. The Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has not fielded any candidate for the bypoll for the constituency in the state's Puravanchal region (eastern Uttar Pradesh).The bypoll will also be an opportunity for the ruling BJP dispensation to assert its hold in Uttar Pradesh. If the SP registers a win in Ghosi, it will strengthen Yadav's position and role within the opposition INDIA bloc, and also seal his candidature for leading the bloc in the state during the general elections.On Sunday, Mr Yadav had appealed to voters in Ghosi to support his party's candidate and \"teach the BJP, which purchases MLAs, a lesson\".In a post on the SP's handle on X, the party's chief had said the by-poll to the assembly segment is in discussion now because \"the people of the country are affected by inflation, corruption and atrocities, caused by the BJP, I feel the people of Ghosi will defeat it\".While seeking support for Mr Chauhan, Chief Minister Adityanath had said only those who witnessed the 2005 Mau riots can understand the importance of Ghosi.\"At that time, the SP was in power and it could not do anything. Now, those who instigated the riots are seen begging for their lives in a wheelchair,\" he had said in an apparent reference to gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, a five-time MLA from Mau.On the support received from constituents of the INDIA alliance, Yadav had said such an election has hardly been seen in Uttar Pradesh, where \"all boundaries from caste to religion were broken for an SP candidate\".During the campaign for the bypoll on August 20, a youth threw ink at Mr Chauhan -- a prominent OBC leader. The incident occurred when he was being welcomed by BJP supporters at Adri Chatti after attending a public meeting in Kopaganj block.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMr Chauhan was a minister in the previous BJP government.

(File)New Delhi:The Delhi High Court has granted bail to former CMD of the Amrapali Group of Companies Anil Kumar Sharma, who was arrested in a case of allegedly cheating homebuyers.The high court said a perusal of the charge sheet revealed that 50 witnesses have been cited by the prosecution and evidently, it is going to be a protracted trial and no useful purpose will be served by keeping him in custody. Keeping the law laid down by the Supreme Court in perspective and considering the fact that the petitioner (Sharma) has already undergone one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for the offence under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), I am of the view that the petitioner is entitled to the benefit of Section 436A CrPC which has been held to be a mandatory provision by the Supreme Court, Justice Vikas Mahajan said.An FIR was registered by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police on the complaint of Anubhav Jain who bought 26 flats in Tower G-1 of Mr Sharma's company's project Amrapali Silicon City' proposed to be developed in Sector 76, Noida.During the investigation, it was found that Tower G-1 in the project was never sanctioned by the Noida Authority and in furtherance of criminal conspiracy, Mr Sharma sold or allotted 26 flats in that tower to the complainant who, after being induced by the accused persons, agreed to invest and made full and final payment of Rs 6.6 crore for the flats in November 2011.On February 28, 2019, Mr Sharma and two other co-accused Shiv Priya and Ajay Kumar were arrested in the case.Senior advocate Pramod Kumar Dubey, representing Mr Sharma, submitted that the maximum sentence for the offence of cheating with which under Section 420 IPC with which the accused has been charged is seven years whereas he has been in custody for more than three years and six months.He said that in view of the mandatory provisions of Section 436A CrPC, the petitioner is entitled to statutory bail after having undergone detention for more than one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for the offence under Section 420 IPC.The counsel submitted that the prosecution has cited as many as 50 witnesses and the conclusion of trial is likely to take a long time and urged the high court to grant regular bail to Mr Sharma.The bail plea was opposed by the prosecutor, who argued that it was a multi-victim scam and the benefit of section 436A should not be extended to the accused and sought dismissal of the petition.As per Section 436A CrPC, a person can be released from custody if he has spent more than half of the maximum sentence prescribed for the offence.The high court granted bail to Mr Sharma on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and two sureties of the like amount.It directed him not to leave the city without prior permission of the court and that he shall appear the trial court as and when the matter is taken up for hearing.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com Appellant/ applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity and shall not communicate with or come in contact with the victim/complainant or any family members of the victim/complainant, the high court said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

I am here (main hoon na), doors of my office and home are always open for every student. Don't hesitate. Learn to share the stress.

Last year, the figure was 15.A packed schedule, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, the burden of parents' expectations and homesickness are the common struggles of the students here.In his letter, the Kota collector expressed concern over the suicide incidents and urged students not to get disheartened over failures.Referring to the students who recently allegedly died by suicide here, Mr Bunkar wrote, \"You have gone, but before going, you should have thought what would happen to your parents who were committed to fulfilling your dreams by willingly sacrificing whatever they had.\"\"You all became members of my family on the very first day you reached this city to fulfil your dreams and I am constantly in an effort to care for you and to provide you a happy environment here,\" the collector wrote to the students.Mr Bunkar, in his letter, also recollected the joyous time he spent during interaction with some students.\"All of you work very hard to attain your target,\" the collector said, adding, \"If one road is closed, several other roads are open and waiting for you.\"\"With a little fall in ranking in a test, you take yourself broken down, sink into tension and pack yourself in a room and continue to think that nothing could happen now,\" Mr Bunkar pointed out to the students, while adding that \"failure is the first step to success\" and none of their failures was a parameter to decide their personality.The collector exhorted the students to explore the city and visit the nature parks and recreation centres for relaxation.\"Just once come out and see what is not there in my city, the beautiful riverfront, rising waves of River Chambal, fascinating gardens and groves; every circle is eager to welcome you,\" the collector urged the students.He also advised students to take some time out to meet friends and for other fun activities so that they feel refreshed.Mr Bunkar also mentioned in the letter the initiatives taken for the students to release them from stress and to address their concerns. He also called upon students to explore their potential as there were several avenues to a bright future.Concluding his letter to students with an inspirational note, he said, \"Dear students, you are strong, have got a lot to live life. You have the courage to move on ahead surmounting every weakness and difficulty. Believe it, nobody can defeat you until you yourself succumb to defeat.\"After a rise in student suicides in 2016, the then collector of Kota Ravi Kumar Surpur wrote an emotional letter to parents of coaching students asking them not to burden their wards with their expectations and dreams.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)HelplinesVandrevala Foundation for Mental Health9999666555orhelp@vandrevalafoundation.comTISS iCall022-25521111(Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)",

        "text": "Mayawati's orders are that we should completely stay away from the by-election, said the leader (File)Lucknow:Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has asked the party's supporters to stay away from the bypoll to the Ghosi assembly seat, voting for which will be held on Tuesday, a functionary has said.The bypoll was necessitated following the resignation of Samajwadi Party MLA Dara Singh Chauhan, who joined the BJP.As per Mayawati's directions, leaders and workers are busy preparing for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Vishwanath Pal -- the party's Uttar Pradesh unit president -- told PTI on Monday.\"Behanji (Mayawati) is our leader. Her orders are that we should completely stay away from the by-election. We have nothing to do with the bypoll and are preparing for the Lok Sabha elections,\" he added.Voting in the bypoll will be held on Tuesday from 7 am to 6 pm, an official said. Counting of votes will be held on September 8.While Mr Dara Singh Chauhan is seeking re-election on a BJP ticket, the Samajwadi Party has fielded Sudhakar Singh.The bypoll is the first electoral showdown between the BJP and an INDIA bloc constituent in Uttar Pradesh, with leaders of both sides going all out to drum up support for their candidates.Mr Pal said, in an apparent reference to Mr Chauhan's return to the BJP, \"Large-scale corruption is going on in the state by splitting MLAs. The anti-defection law was made so that such things do not happen. But, despite this, people have started a new thing.\"\"The MLA who has been elected for a five-year term is made to resign on allegations of corruption and then included in the party. After this, elections are held again and the burden of the expenditure is forced upon the public,\" he added.Mr Pal said this is not in the public interest and added that the BSP boycotts such acts.Asked if the party cadre and supporters will boycott the bypoll, Mr Pal said, \"Behanji (Mayawati) is our leader and she has told us to completely stay away from the by-election. The public is being cheated and a conspiracy hatched. When we are away from the election, where does the question of voting arise?\"Mr Pal added that Mayawati's message has reached all party workers. \"When our party is out of the election, how will we cast our votes?\" he asked.The BSP won from the Ghosi seat in the 1993 and the 2007 assembly elections.There are 10 candidates contesting the bypoll. The BSP has not fielded one.Although the bypoll will have no bearing on the BJP government, which enjoys a comfortable majority in the 403-member House, its outcome is equally important as it comes just before next year's Lok Sabha election and could be an indicator of what is in store in next year's Lok Sabha elections.Opposition INDIA bloc members Congress and the Left parties have thrown their weight behind the Samajwadi Party nominee.A win for the Samajwadi Party will strengthen party chief Akhilesh Yadav's position and role within the INDIA alliance and also seal his candidature for leading the bloc in the politically important state, which sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe ruling NDA recently inducted the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party with its chief Om Prakash Rajbhar vigorously campaigning for the BJP candidate.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

At this juncture, while considering the present application for permitting the petitioner (Kanoria) to go abroad, this court does not want to make any observations on the merits of the case as it can prejudice both the parties. The petitioner has not been named in the FIR or in ECIR nor has any complaint registered against him, Justice Subramonium Prasad said.The high court noted the material on record indicated that the petitioner has been called for investigation on eight dates and he has appeared before the Enforcement Directorate on all the dates. Considering the fact that the petitioner wants to go abroad for the purpose of his medical treatment and material on record does suggest that the petitioner is a patient of epilepsy and is being treated by a doctor in Boston, USA from 2010, this court is inclined to permit the petitioner to go to Boston, USA only for the purpose of medical treatment from September 6 to 18 , it said.The court noted the material on record showed SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd (SIFL) and SREI Equipment Finance Ltd (SEFL), which are Kanoria group's non-banking finance companies registered in Kolkata, are engaged in the business of financing infrastructure and equipment.According to the prosecution, an FIR was registered in Uttar Pradesh's Jaunpur in 2021 against the members of Kanoria family, who were running these two companies, for the alleged offences of cheating, forgery for the purpose of cheating, using forged document as genuine, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy under the IPC.It was stated that the petitioner was the son of Sunil Kanoria, one of the promoters and directors of the Kanoria Group. The petitioner was one of the beneficiaries of the Kanoria Foundation which is the promoting entity of SIFL and SEFL through another company called Adisri Commercial Private Ltd.The prosecution has alleged SIFL and the SEFL defaulted on the repayment of dues to their creditors following which insolvency proceedings have been initiated against them.The total claim comes to over Rs 32,000 crore and more than Rs 10,000 crore has been reported as fraudulent transactions, it alleged.Senior standing counsel Ravi Prakash and advocates Aman Rewaria and Yasharth Shukla, representing the Enforcement Directorate, contended that the treatment of the medical condition for which the petitioner was going to the US is easily available in India.The counsel contended the investigation is at a very crucial stage and permitting the petitioner to go abroad will hamper the probe as he was not cooperating with the investigation and was giving false answers.The ED's counsel said the petitioner has got assets across the world and, if he is permitted to go abroad, he could tamper with the proceeds of crime. They said his wife is in the US and there is a possibility that he might not return to India.The application to travel abroad was filed in the pending petition in which the petitioner has sought quashing of the LOC opened against him by the Enforcement Directorate.Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, appearing for the petitioner, submitted he was a patient of epilepsy and was being treated by a doctor in Boston since 2010, and that he has been advised to get an electroencephalogram (EEG) test done there.The high court said, The petitioner shall furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 100 crores to the satisfaction of the registrar general of this court with two sureties in the like amount of persons who are living in India. He shall remain in Boston throughout his period of stay abroad and will not travel outside Boston, the court directed.It also asked Kanoria to provide the number of the phone he will use during his stay abroad, adding the phone shall be operational at all times.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com The petitioner shall not travel to any other country other than the USA.

        "text": "Courts can't be used to pressure a party to act in a particular manner, the Delhi High Court saidNew Delhi:Courts cannot be used as \"marriage facilitators\" between parties in sexual offence cases, the Delhi High Court said today.The judicial system, the High Court said, cannot be used to settle scores or pressure a party to act in a particular manner.The court made the observations while dismissing an anticipatory bail petition by an accused in a case of alleged rape of a woman on the false pretext of marriage.The accused sought pre-arrest bail on the ground that he was ready to marry the victim. The petition said the woman's father, who was earlier not ready for the inter-caste marriage, was now prepared to accept the marriage.Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, however, observed that the facts and documents on record showed that both the accused as well as the complainant took \"the judicial system and the investigating agencies for a ride and are trying to manipulate the judicial system to their advantage in different ways\".\"In this court's opinion, the courts of law cannot be used as a forum for the purpose of facilitating marriages and be used as marriage facilitators by first lodging an FIR alleging that the accused, after establishing physical relations, had refused to get married to the victim and later appear before the court for grant of bail which they have been opposing for many months,\" the court said.The state opposed the plea on the grounds that the allegations were serious in nature and the accused never joined the investigation and is missing.The court said the judicial system and the investigating agency have invested time and resources into the case, and it has become a trend to burden the judicial system with such complaints that clog the dockets of the courts.\"In many cases, when bail is granted at the request of the complainant, after some time, applications/petitions for cancellation of bail are filed before this Court on the ground that after obtaining bail, the accused did not fulfil his promise of getting married or that after getting married to the rape victim, the victim was abandoned by the accused,\" the court said.\"The courts cannot be used as matrimonial facilitators for the purpose of pressurizing the accused to get married to the victim or be denied bail, or by the accused for obtaining bail by asking the complainant to appear before the Court and state that he was ready to get married to her,\" stated the court.In the present case, the court noted, there was nothing in the trial court proceedings or the earlier proceedings here to suggest that the parties were contemplating getting married or that the accused had even admitted to having a consensual relationship with the alleged victim.It said it is only at this stage that the accused \"presented an entirely contradictory stance of marriage\".\"This is nothing short of taking the judicial system and the investigating agency for a ride by both the parties through their conduct and different stands taken before the courts and the investigating agency,\" the court observed.\"The judicial system cannot be used either to settle scores with each other or pressurize any party to act in a particular manner to reach one's goal. Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, this Court does not find it a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail as the case has travelled from the point of lodging of the FIR till the present point of the investigation,\" it said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe court said truth has to prevail for which custodial interrogation of the accused may be required.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The BJP has slammed the silence of Rahul Gandhi, claiming it marks him as anti-Hindu.Congress ally in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena UBT, has also indicated support to the DMK leader, who is a Tamil Nadu minister and son of Chief Minister MK Stalin.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, senior Shiv Sena UBT leader Priyanka Chaturvedi pointed to the \"inclusiveness\" of the \"Sanatan Dharma\".\"Sanatan Dharm stands for eternal truth - way to live life, conscience & being. Sanatanis have long withstood attacks by invaders to end their identity yet have not just survived but thrived. Country's bedrock, linked to sanatan dharm, has been of inclusiveness of all faiths and identities,\" her post read.On Monday, CPI's D Raja told The New Indian that Sanatana Dharma promotes inequality. \"Everyone should understand that Sanatana is not dharma (religion).

This was because of the \"proximate times and places of incidents in the FIRs\", the judge said.He said the bail granted to Hussain by a court higher in the hierarchy to this court has created a \"material change in the circumstances\" in the favour of the accused.\"Many of the witnesses are common in all these three FIRs and the Delhi High Court has appreciated the merits of the case in two of the FIRs i.e, 91/2020 and 92/2020, to find the applicant entitled to bail. There may not be a reason to take a different view in that situation for this court,\" the judge said.\"This material change in the circumstances in itself becomes a ground to grant bail to the accused or applicant in this case as well. Hence, application is allowed,\" the court said.Hussain was granted bail on furnishing a personal bond and a surety bond of Rs 1 lakh each with one surety of the like amount.Other conditions of the bail include that he will not leave the country, not try to influence witnesses and will provide his mobile phone number to the court.During the proceedings, Special Public Prosecutor Madhukar Pandey said the bail order of the high court was not a \"binding precedent\".Hussain's counsel said the incidents mentioned in the three FIRs were \"very proximate in time and place\", and the present case was also based on \"similar kinds of evidence and circumstances\".PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comHence, if Hussain was granted bail in the two FIRs, then on the grounds of parity, he should be granted bail in this case as well, he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The AAP, with their history of scams, never had the intent for the development of the national capital.\"She claimed it was the Central government that allocated Rs 700 crore for the construction, repair, maintenance and beautification of roads in the national capital.\"These central funds were used by PWD and MCD for the makeover. The work done by these agencies that they are quoting today was undertaken through the funds of the Central government.

        "text": "Vice President praised the role of women scientists in the success of Chandrayaan and the Aditya Mission.Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Monday that the day is not far when women will get proper representation in Parliament and legislative assemblies through a constitutional amendment.Mr Dhankhar said this while participating in a dialogue programme on the topic of \"Women's Participation in Nation Building\" with the students of the Maharani Mahavidyalaya, affiliated with the Rajasthan University, Jaipur.Interacting with the female students, the vice-president said the sky is the limit for women as they are creating new models of success in every field, including administration, the Army and the corporate world.He asked women to make their own decisions and become financially self-reliant. \"Do not copy men, they are not better than you, keep yourselves original,\" he added.Mr Dhankhar gave three mantras to the female students -- never get stressed as nothing is achieved by that, never be afraid of failure and if a good idea comes to your mind, implement it on the ground.He appealed to youngsters not to get overly competitive and said they should choose their careers in accordance with their interests.Mr Dhankhar expressed confidence that the day is not far when women will get their due representation in Parliament and legislative assemblies through an amendment to the Constitution. He asserted that if women get this reservation soon, India will become a world power before 2047.Talking about education for women, Mr Dhankhar said by educating a boy, only one family achieves progress, but when a girl gets educated, several families benefit from it.Replying to a question asked by a student on women's safety, Mr Dhankhar said it is not only the work of the government machinery but the society, individuals and institutions will have to make joint efforts to create a safe environment for women.Asserting that anti-social elements should be dealt with strictly, he expressed happiness that the country is about to change the penal code made by the British.The vice president said he derived all his strength from his maternal grandmother, paternal grandmother, mother and wife. \"There were many ups and downs in my five-decade-long public life, but these women stood behind me as firm as a rock,\" he added.Highlighting the change in the attitude towards women in the country, Dhankhar said he has promoted the gender-neutral word \"chairperson\" in the Rajya Sabha instead of \"chairman\". He said the \"Panel of Vice-Chairman\" is now called the \"Panel of Vice-Chairperson\".\"For the first time, I have appointed 50 per cent women in the panel of the deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha and their performance has been excellent,\" he added.Mr Dhankhar also said whenever he decides the names of delegation members for a trip within the country or abroad, he gives priority to women.He said there have been many attempts to hinder the progress of women but now, society's attitude towards them is changing.\"For the first time in 2019, 78 women MPs were elected to the Lok Sabha. The world cannot achieve progress without the contribution of women,\" Mr Dhankhar said.Praising the role of women scientists in the success of Chandrayaan and the Aditya Mission, he said India will change the world on the basis of its women's power.\"During my visits abroad, I have seen that a representative from India is viewed with great respect. Ten years ago, India was counted among the weak five countries and today, India is among the top five economies of the world and soon, it will be the third-largest economy,\" he said.Stressing that wastage of natural resources, such as electricity, water and fuel, should be stopped, Dhankhar said human beings are the trustees of these resources, which should be used according to their requirements.The vice president appealed to youngsters to perform their fundamental duties alongside enjoying their fundamental rights.He also said there should be no compromise on economic nationalism for the sake of little monetary gains while wondering why articles such as toys and earthen lamps for Diwali decoration should come from outside the country.Seeing his former professors present in the auditorium, Mr Dhankhar, who is an alumnus of Rajasthan University, said it was an auspicious day for him as he got an opportunity to meet his teachers on the eve of Teacher's Day.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comDr Sudesh Dhankhar, Vice-Chancellor of the Rajasthan University, Professor Rajeev Jain, principal of the Maharani Mahavidyalaya, Professor Nimali Singh and other teachers were present on the occasion.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

A seer in Uttar Pradesh has apparently announced a 10-crore bounty on the head of the sports minister amid the massive backlash sparked by his comments on \"Sanatana Dharma\".\"I will pay Rs 10 crore cash reward to anyone who beheads Stalin and brings his head to me. If no one dares to kill Stalin, I will myself find him and kill him,\" Paramhans Acharya, the chief priest of the Tapaswi Chawni temple of Ayodhya, was quoted as saying by news agency Press Trust of India.Speaking at an event in Chennai, Mr Udhayanidhi Stalin said Paramahansa Acharya in Uttar Pradesh, has announced that \"he would give me Rs 10 crore to shave my head for talking about Sanatana (Dharma)\".\"A 10-rupee comb is enough to comb my head,\" he said, making light of the threat. In Tamil, the word for chop or slice also means combing hair.\"This is not new to us. We are not the ones who are afraid of all these threats. I am the grandson of the artist who put his head on the rail track for Tamil,\" said Mr Stalin, who is the son of Chief Minister MK Stalin and grandson of M Karunanidhi, one of the state's iconic leaders.A five-time Chief Minister, Karunanidhi had led the rationalist and anti-Brahmin Dravidian movement started by Periyar.The incident Mr Stalin referred to was in 1953 and marked the rise of Karunanidhi in Tamil politics. To protest against the renaming of a village after the industrialist family of Dalmias, who were building a cement factory there, DMK workers, led by Karunanidhi, lay down on the tracks to register their protest.Over the weekend, Karunanidhi's grandson triggered controversy with a speech at an event. \"Sanatana (Dharma) is like malaria and dengue and so it must be eradicated and not opposed,\" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The comment set off an uproar, with the BJP declaring that it was equivalent to \"a call for genocide\". It has also put the new Opposition Bloc INDIA in a dilemma ahead of a series of state polls and general elections next year. While Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and Trinamool Congress have thumbs downed the comment, the Congress has taken a nuanced stand. Other senior leaders from key parties have maintained silence.Today, Mr Udhayanidhi Stalin doubled down on his remarks. Calling the BJP allegation \"fake news\", the minister said, \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi talks of Congress mukt bharat. Does it mean murder of Congress members?\".\"We talk about a principle. What's Sanatana Dharma first of all? It is explained as eternal, permanent and unchanging. Our Dravidian model is about change in everything Some years ago, they said women should not study. Many years ago it was said women should not cover their upper body and that they shouldn't enter temples. We have changed everything. This is Dravidian model,\" he added.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comFounded on the rationalist principles of Periyar, the DMK for decades has opposed Sanatana Dharma and has often reaped rich political dividends.They argue that for generations, large populations were oppressed by practitioners of Sanatana Dharma on casteist lines, denying them equality, education and even entry into places of worship, besides several other forms cruelty against women including Sati.",

IST, it said.Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space based observatory to study the Sun from a halo orbit around first sun-earth Lagrangian point (L1), which is located roughly 1.5 million km from earth.The first earth-bound manoeuvre was successfully performed on September 3.The spacecraft will undergo two more earth-bound orbital manoeuvres before placing in the transfer orbit towards the Lagrange point L1. Aditya-L1 is expected to arrive at the intended orbit at the L1 point after about 127 days.ISRO's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C57) on September 2 had successfully launched the Aditya-L1 spacecraft, from the Second Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota.After a flight duration of 63 minutes and 20 seconds, Aditya-L1 spacecraft was successfully injected into an elliptical orbit of 235x19500 km around the earth.According to ISRO, a satellite placed in the halo orbit around the L1 point has the major advantage of continuously viewing the Sun without any occultation /eclipses. This will provide a greater advantage of observing the solar activities and its effect on space weather in real time.Aditya-L1 carries seven scientific payloads indigenously developed by ISRO and national research laboratories including Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, and Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune.The payloads are to observe the photosphere, chromosphere and the outermost layers of the Sun (the corona) using electromagnetic and particle and magnetic field detectors.Using the special vantage point L1, four payloads directly view the Sun and the remaining three payloads carry out in-situ studies of particles and fields at the Lagrange point L1, thus providing important scientific studies of the propagatory effect of solar dynamics in the interplanetary medium.The suits of Aditya L1 payloads are expected to provide the most crucial information to understand the problem of coronal heating, coronal mass ejection, pre-flare and flare activities and their characteristics, dynamics of space weather, propagation of particles and fields.According to scientists, there are five Lagrangian points (or parking areas) between the Earth and the Sun where a small object tends to stay if put there. The Lagrange Points are named after Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange for his prize-winning paper -- \"Essai sur le Probl me des Trois Corps, 1772.\" These points in space can be used by spacecraft to remain there with reduced fuel consumption.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comAt a Lagrange point, the gravitational pull of the two large bodies (the Sun and the Earth) equals the necessary centripetal force required for a small object to move with them.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The case involved individuals Padamchand Jain (Proprietor: M/s. Shree Shyam Tubewell Company), Mahesh Mittal (Proprietor M/s Shree Ganpati Tubewell Company), and others.They were suspected of offering bribes to public servants to gain illegal protection, secure tenders, obtain bill approvals, and cover up irregularities related to work executed in various tenders issued by the Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED).During the search operations, the ED seized unaccounted cash amounting to Rs 2.32 Crore, a 1 Kg gold bar worth Rs 64 lakh, and various incriminating documents, including digital evidence, hard disks, and mobile devices. These findings suggest extensive transactions carried out by the suspects in collusion with PHED officials.The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) has taken a step in the case of alleged money laundering involving M/s GDS Builders Pvt. Ltd., its director Uma Sankar Patro, and others.Properties amounting to approximately Rs 19.67 Crores have been provisionally attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA).This includes movable assets such as bank balances and mutual fund balances totalling Rs 9,49,657, along with 57 immovable assets valued at Rs 19,57,73,370, located in Puri and Bhubaneswar.The investigation was initiated by the ED based on three FIRs registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Bhubaneswar, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act.These cases were filed against Uma Shankar Patro, the Director of M/s GDS Builders Pvt. Ltd., three officers from the United Bank of India (UBI) Nayapalli Branch in Bhubaneswar, and private individual borrowers. Subsequently, chargesheets were filed by the CBI.The ED's investigation uncovered a conspiracy involving the accused bank officials of UBI, who collaborated with Uma Shankar Patro and the borrowers in obtaining housing loans in 2017.It was revealed that Uma Shankar Patro, along with family members, misappropriated approximately Rs 18.79 Crore of public money.Furthermore, Uma Sankar Patro, through his jewellery firm M/s. Dwarka Jewellers, committed fraud in the Cash Credit loan obtained from Indian Bank (formerly Allahabad Bank), Bhubaneswar, causing a significant financial loss of Rs 7.14 Crore to the bank. These funds were allegedly laundered by Uma Sankar Patro through the bank accounts of M/s. GDS Builders Pvt. Ltd.Earlier, on May 18, 2023, the ED conducted searches at eight premises associated with Uma Shankar Patro and related individuals. During these operations, cash amounting to Rs 15 Lakhs, gold jewellery weighing 1.978 Kgs (valued at Rs 1.30 Crore), incriminating documents, and electronic devices were seized.The investigation into this money laundering case is ongoing.ED has seized nine immovable properties located in Maharashtra and Karnataka, with a total estimated value of 65.53 Crore, under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, according to a post on X by ED.This action is part of an investigation related to illegal remittances made by M/s Venkateshwara Hatcheries Pvt Ltd (M/s VHPL) to its wholly owned subsidiary, M/s Venky's Overseas Limited (M/s VOL), UK, since 2011.The ED's investigation revealed that M/s VHPL falsely declared the business of M/s VOL to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as Agriculture and Mining (rearing of ducks, hens, etc.).However, despite more than 11 years since its incorporation, M/s VOL never initiated any such business activity. It was found that funds remitted by M/s VHPL to M/s VOL were primarily used for the purchase of an immovable property named \"Alexander House\" in the United Kingdom.This property, spanning 90 acres, was acquired by M/s VOL with funds remitted by M/s VHPL.The investigation established that M/s VHPL did not intend to conduct genuine business through its subsidiary, M/s VOL, and had created it as a front to acquire immovable property in the UK for the benefit of directors, employees, and family members of M/s VHPL.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comConsequently, the equivalent value of properties held in India has been seized under Section 37A of FEMA.

The sooner this trend is put to an end, the better,\" the bench said.The top court said preventive detention, conceived as an extraordinary measure by the framers of India's Constitution, has been rendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it were available for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings.\"To unchain the shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguards enshrined in our Constitution, particularly under the 'golden triangle' formed by Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced,\" the bench said.While Article 14 relates to equality before law, Article 19 pertains to freedom of speech and expression, and Article 21 provides India's citizens right to life and personal liberty. All these are fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution to the citizens of the country.The top court said while deciding on the legality of preventive detention orders, the courts are required to ensure the order is based on the requisite satisfaction of the detaining authority.Referring to the instant case, the top court said the authority concerned had failed to differentiate between offences that create a \"law and order\" situation and those that tend to prejudicially affect \"public order\".It said Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Dacoits, Drug-Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Land Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders Act 1986 is an extraordinary statute.The law, it said, should not have been invoked when ordinary criminal law provided sufficient means to address the apprehensions leading to the impugned detention order.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The Permanent Mission of India completely rejects the news release as it is not only unwarranted, presumptive and misleading but also betrays a complete lack of understanding on the situation in Manipur and the steps taken by Government of India to address it, said the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva.India's response came after a group of UN experts raised alarm about reports of serious human rights violations and abuses in Manipur, including alleged acts of sexual violence, extrajudicial killings, home destruction, forced displacement, torture and ill-treatment.Rejecting the news release by the Special Procedure Mandate Holders (SPMH) titled India: UN experts alarmed by continuing abuses in Manipur', the Permanent Mission of India expressed disappointment and surprise that the SPMHs chose to issue the press release without waiting for the 60 days period for the Indian government to respond to a joint communication issued on the same topic on August 29, 2023.The Indian mission expressed hope that in the future, the SPMH would be more objective in their assessment, based on the facts.It hoped that the SPMH would refrain from commenting on the developments, which have no relevance to the mandate given to them by the Council and abide by the established procedure for issuing news releases and wait for inputs sought from the Government of India before doing so. The Indian mission reiterated that India is a democratic country, with an abiding commitment to the rule of law and to promoting and protecting the human rights of our people. \"Indian law enforcement authorities and security forces are committed to dealing with law-and-order situations strictly in accordance with the principles of legal certainty, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination, it said.In their news release, the UN experts had said they were appalled\" by the reports and images of gender-based violence targeting hundreds of women and girls of all ages, and predominantly of the Kuki ethnic minority. The alleged violence includes gang rape, parading women naked in the street, severe beatings causing death, and burning them alive or dead, the experts said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe experts also pointed to an inadequate humanitarian response in the wake of the grave humanitarian situation in Manipur following the latest round of community conflict between the predominantly Hindu Meitei and the predominantly Christian Kuki ethnic communities that erupted in May 2023.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Mr Dhankhar said the day is not far when women will get due representation in the country's legislatures.New Delhi:The bill to reserve 33% of seats in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies for women has got a fillip after Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Monday that the day is not far when women will get due representation in the country's legislatures. The legislation had been passed by the Rajya Sabha in 2010 but lapsed after the Lok Sabha did not clear it.The Vice President's comment has sparked speculation that the women's reservation bill may be moved during the special session of parliament from September 18-22, the agenda for which is yet to be revealed.On Tuesday, Telangana MLC and Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's daughter K Kavitha also wrote a letter to presidents of all 47 political parties with representation in parliament and urged them to set aside political differences and prioritise the passage of the bill in the upcoming special session.A bill seeking to reserve 33% seats for women was first moved by the Deve Gowda government in 1996. The UPA government then reintroduced the legislation, officially known as the Constitution (One Hundred and Eighth Amendment) Bill, in 2008.The legislation was passed by the Rajya Sabha in 2010, but the 15th Lok Sabha could not pass the bill and it lapsed following its dissolution in 2014. Parties such as the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal have opposed the bill in its current form, demanding \"a quota within the quota\".The parties have argued that the reservation should provide for a quota for Dalit, backward, extremely backward and minority communities. An RJD leader had said that the party does not have a problem if the reservation for women needs to be hiked to 50% to provide a quota to these sections, but it is meaningless without it.Being a constitutional amendment, the bill will require the support of two-thirds of the members in the Lok Sabha. It was part of the BJP's election manifesto in 2014 and, sources said, its passage is likely to benefit the party by helping it consolidate the votes of women.Speaking at an event on \"Women's Participation in Nation Building\" at a college in Jaipur on Monday, Vice President Dhankhar had said that the day is not far when women will get their due representation in Parliament and legislative assemblies through an amendment to the Constitution. He said that if this reservation is given soon, India will become a world power before 2047.Mr Dhankhar asserted that the sky is the limit for women as they are creating new models of success in every field, including administration, the corporate world, and the Army.In her letter on Tuesday, Bharat Rashtra Samithi Leader K Kavitha, who is also a former Lok Sabha MP, asserted \"that increased women's representation is not a matter of exclusivity but a means to build a more equitable and balanced political landscape\". She urged all parties to recognise the urgency of this matter and back the women's reservation bill.In a written reply to a question in July, the Centre had told the Rajya Sabha that the women's reservation bill requires \"careful consideration\" on the basis of consensus among all political parties before it is brought to Parliament.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIn his reply, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal had said gender justice is an important commitment of the government.In March, the Congress had asked the BJP to make its stand clear on the bill and demanded that it be tabled in the Lok Sabha.",

The day, also known asKrishna Janmashtami, Krishnashtami, Gokulashtami, Ashtami Rohini, Srikrishna Jayanti, and Sree Jayanthi, marks the birth of Lord Krishna.He is believed to be the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu and is revered across India. Born in a dungeon in present-day Mathura in Uttar Pradesh at midnight to Queen Devaki and King Vasudeva, Krishna is described in Hindu epics as the god of love, tenderness, and compassion. He is also known for playing mischievous pranks and performing miracles with his supreme powers.This year, Janmashtami will be celebrated on both the 6th and 7th of September.History and significance of Krishna JanmashtamiAs per belief, Kansa, brother of Queen Devaki, heard a prophecy that her eighth son would be the reason for his death. Upon hearing this, Kansa threw both Devaki and her husband Vasudev in prison and one by one killed all of their six children. Kansa tried to eliminate Krishna but before he could do that, Krishna was safely sent out of the dark dungeon. King Vasudeva crossed the Yamuna River carrying Krishna over his head in a basket and left him in the care of his friends Yashoda and Nanda in Vrindavan.Vasudev returned with their girl child born on the same day to present her to King Kansa in the hope that he wouldn't harm her since the prophecy said that their eighth 'son' would be the cause of Kansa's death. However, he threw the little girl against a rock. Instead of getting harmed she rose to the air taking the form of Goddess Durga and warning him about his death.Krishna then grew up and killed Kansa, thus fulfilling the prophecy and saving the town from the merciless rule of Kansa. The day of Krishna Janmashtami celebrates the love, warmth, and beauty that Lord Krishna represents.Rituals and CelebrationsOn this day, devotees observe fast, wear traditional clothes, bathe and decorate Lord Krishna's idols in new clothes and jewelry, and seek blessings for the well-being of their families. People also decorate their houses with flowers and rangoli and observe ritualistic fasts. While a section of people observe 'nirjala vrat' until midnight, considered the birth time of Lord Krishna, some eat light,sattvikmeals throughout the day. Since Lord Krishna was born at midnight, the puja for him is performed inNishita Kaal. Devotees offer Krishna's favouritemaakhan(white butter), milk, and curd to the idols after marking his birth at midnight.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIntemples, festivities begin before dawn and extend all day until midnight, the time when Lord Krishna was born.

Just because many opposition parties have formed an alliance and called it INDIA, will the Centre change the name of the country? The country belongs to 140 crore people, not to one party. If the name of the alliance is changed to Bharat, will they change the name of Bharat to BJP?\"Mr Kejriwal's party colleague and Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha also hit out at the BJP and said that the country does not belong to one political party.\"The BJP's recent move to change the reference from 'President of India' to 'President of Bharat' on official G20 summit invitations has raised eyebrows and ignited a public debate.

Whatever is happening today, no one knows the direction that the country is heading in. Democracy is in danger and the Constitution is being ripped to shreds. Simultaneous polls are an example of this.

I have never heard of a former President heading a committee. The committee will be criticised as well as praised, and you have needlessly involved the former President in this.\"Mr Gehlot said the Centre could have taken the opposition into confidence and the fact that it did not do so makes people doubt its intentions. He said the government was well within its rights to call the special Parliament session from September 18-22, but it has still not told the nation why it has been called. \"These things are not good in a democracy,\" he said.The chief minister asserted that the people of Rajasthan have made up their minds to re-elect the Congress government in the state.Asked whether he was worried that the BJP had failed to form a government in Rajasthan after losing in the elections, and that it would take revenge, the chief minister said, \"They (the BJP) should know who they are dealing with.\"When NDTV followed up and asked where the uncharacteristic aggression was coming from, he said, \"It's coming from the heart.

He said crime is happening in the state, but the accused are being caught within hours.\"As soon as our government was formed, we made registering an FIR mandatory.

The top court was criticising a trial court and the Patna High Court for awarding the death penalty to a man accused of raping and killing a girl in 2015 when she came over to watch television at his home.Setting aside the death sentence, the top court remitted the case back to the High Court for reconsideration after noting serious flaws in the investigation.The Supreme Court was hearing an appeal filed by the man on death row.According to the prosecution, the accused raped and strangled the girl on June 1, 2015, at his home in Bihar's Bhagalpur district.In 2017, a trial court in Bhagalpur convicted the man of rape and murder and sentenced him to death, holding the offence fell under the rarest of rare category.The Patna High Court in 2018 dismissed his appeal against conviction and upheld the death penalty.A Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai, JB Pardiwala, and Prashant Kumar Mishra said there were very serious lapses in the investigation and even the Forensic Science Laboratory report was not obtained.\"The aforesaid lapse is just the tip of the iceberg. We are at pains to state that it is a very serious flaw on the part of the investigating officer and that too in such a serious matter,\" the bench said.The court said another serious flaw in the present case on the part of the investigating officer was the failure to subject the appellant to a medical examination by a medical practitioner.No explanation, much less any reasonable explanation, has been offered for such a serious flaw on the part of the investigating officer, it said.The top court said it was aghast to see that the trial court and the High Court proceeded on the basis that the man was guilty as he came to the girl's house on the day of the incident and lured her to go to his place to watch TV.However, witnesses had told the police that it was another juvenile accused who went to the girl's house and took her along.\"Neither the defence counsel nor the public prosecutor nor the presiding officer of the trial court and unfortunately even the High Court thought fit to look into the aforesaid aspect of the matter and try to reach to the truth...\"The presiding officer of the trial court also remained a mute spectator. It was the duty of the presiding officer to put relevant questions to these witnesses,\" the bench said.The top court said the case being of rape and murder, the trial court judge ought to have acquainted himself with the important material and also with what the only important witnesses of the prosecution had said during the police investigation.\"No doubt he has to remain very vigilant, cautious, fair, and impartial, and not to give even the slightest of impression that he is biased or prejudiced either due to his own personal convictions or views in favour of one or the other party.\"This, however, would not mean that the Judge will simply shut his own eyes and be a mute spectator, acting like a robot or a recording machine to just deliver what stands fed by the parties,\" the bench said.Observing that truth is the cherished principle and the guiding star of the Indian criminal justice system, the top court said the sole idea of the criminal justice system is to see that justice is done.Justice will be said to be done when no innocent person is punished and the guilty person is not allowed to go scot-free, it said.\"Free and fair trial is sine-qua-non of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. If the criminal trial is not free and fair, then the confidence of the public in the judicial fairness of a judge and the justice delivery system would be shaken.\"Denial to a fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as to the victim and the society. No trial can be treated as a fair trial unless there is an impartial judge conducting the trial, an honest, able and fair defence counsel and equally honest, able and fair public prosecutor,\" the bench said.The top court said a fair trial necessarily includes a fair and proper opportunity for the prosecutor to prove the guilt of the accused and an opportunity for the accused to prove his innocence.While remitting the case back to the High Court, the top court noted that the man had been in jail for over nine years now and asked the High Court to take up the matter expeditiously.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"As the appellant convict was in jail for the past more than nine years, his family might be in dire straits.

It is mentioned in the Constitution as also in the discussions of 1946-48,\" it mentions.Coming ahead of parliament's five-day special session starting September 18, for which no agenda has been provided by the government, this has raised speculation to a fever pitch and rekindled the 'India versus Bharat' debate. Many BJP leaders and celebrities including Amitabh Bachchan, Virender Sehwag and others, have hailed \"Bharat\" on social media.It has also sparked indignant protests from the Opposition, which called it the government's knee-jerk reaction to the formation of the INDIA bloc ahead of next year's general election.

(FILE)New Delhi:A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking cancelling of the August 7 notification which restored the Lok Sabha membership of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi following the top court order staying his conviction in a 2019 defamation case over his Modi surname remark.The top court had on August 4 stayed his conviction in the defamation case. Mr Gandhi represents Wayanad in the lower House of Parliament.The Congress leader was disqualified as an MP on March 24 after a Gujarat court convicted and sentenced him to two-year imprisonment for criminal defamation for comments he made about the Modi surname.The Gujarat High Court had later dismissed his petition for a stay on conviction, observing that \"purity in politics\" is the need of the hour.The petition, which was filed in the court on Tuesday by Lucknow-based advocate Ashok Pandey, said it is challenging the August 7 notification issued by the Lok Sabha restoring Mr Gandhi's membership.It claimed that as per provisions contained in Article 102 read with section 8 (3) of the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1951 and the law laid down by a constitution bench of the apex court in B R Kapoor vs State of Tamil Nadu and another, \"the disqualification based on conviction and sentence will continue to operate till it is set aside in appeal.\"While Article 102 of the Constitution deals with disqualification of a member of either House of Parliament, section 8 (3) of the RP Act says a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.The petition has arrayed the Lok Sabha Speaker, the Union of India, the Election Commission of India and Rahul Gandhi as respondents.It has also sought a direction to the Election Commission to notify the vacancy of the seat being held by him and holding fresh election there.The petition claimed Mr Gandhi lost his membership of Lok Sabha when he was convicted for defamation and was awarded two years sentence and \"as such the Speaker was not right is restoring back his lost membership.\"\"In view of order of the Supreme Court staying the conviction of Rahul Gandhi, the petitioner also pray to constitution bench of this court to kindly decide the issue as to whether the conviction of an accused can be stayed by the court of appeal or any court and whether on the basis of stay of conviction, a person who has suffered disqualification by operation of law, will become qualified to be chosen as or for being, a member of Parliament/ State legislature,\" it said.The plea urged the court to decide whether the notification regarding loss of membership of a convicted legislator will be notified by the chairman or speaker of the House concerned or is it the domain of the Election Commission.\"Rahul Gandhi is disqualified from being chosen as or from being a member of Parliament and state legislature till his conviction is not set aside by the court of appeal and so, to restore his membership and to permit him to continue to work as Member of Parliament is in clear violation of Article 102 read with section 8 (3) of the RP Act, 1951,\" it claimed.The top court passed the August 4 order while hearing a petition by Gandhi challenging the Gujarat High Court verdict which had dismissed his plea seeking a stay on his conviction in the defamation case filed by Purnesh Modi over his \"Modi surname\" remark.The court, while granting Mr Gandhi the relief, had said no reason was given by the trial court judge while convicting him except that he was admonished by the top court in a contempt case.Purnesh Modi had filed the criminal defamation case in 2019 against Mr Gandhi over his \"How come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?\" comment made at an election rally in Kolar in Karnataka on April 13, 2019.A metropolitan magistrate's court in Surat had on March 23 sentenced the former Congress president to two years in jail after convicting him under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 499 and 500 (criminal defamation).Following the verdict, Mr Gandhi was disqualified as an MP under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe top court had earlier closed the contempt proceedings against Gandhi for wrongly attributing to it his \"chowkidar chor hai\" remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in connection with the Rafale case, with a warning to be more careful in future, after the senior Congress leader tendered an unconditional apology.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

In the meantime, it is directed that the members of the FHRAI shall use the term 'staff contribution' for the amount of service charge that they are charging,\" the court said.\"The same shall not be more than 10 per cent excluding GST. Menu cards shall specify in bold that no further tip is to be paid to the establishment,\" ordered the court as it clarified that it was only an interim order which is subject to the final outcome in the petitions.The court noted that the two petitioners were the apex bodies which represented the interests of the restaurants.It directed that the matter be listed for hearing on October 3, observing that \"this effects the entire country\".Earlier, the court had asked the petitioners to state if there was any objection in the term \"service charge\" being replaced with alternative terminology, such as \"staff welfare fund\", to prevent confusion in the minds of the consumer that the same is not a government levy.Petitioners had moved the high court last year by fling two separate petitions challenging guidelines prohibiting hotels and restaurants from automatically levying service charge on food bills.The guidelines, issued by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) on July 4 last year, were stayed by the high court later that month.Petitioners have said that service charge, which has been present for the last several years, is a traditional charge and is disturbed amongst those who are not before the customers and the restaurants are seeking the same after displaying due notice on their menu cards and on their premises.They have thus argued that the CCPA order is arbitrary, untenable and ought to be quashed.Seeking dismissal of the petitions, CCPA, in its counter affidavit, said the petitioners have totally failed to appreciate the rights of the consumers, whose hard-earned money is unjustly collected automatically or by default in the name of service charge.It has added that the objective of collecting mandatory service charge from consumers over and above the price of food items and applicable taxes is unlawful as no proportionate service is separately provided to consumers.The high court had on July 20, 2022, stayed the CCPA guideline and said the stay is subject to the petitioners ensuring that the levy of service charge, in addition to the price and taxes, and the obligation of the customer to pay the same is duly and prominently displayed on the menu or other places.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "'Minister Without Portfolio Serves No Purpose': Madras High Court On Senthil Balaji",
        "text": "Chennai:The Madras High Court on Tuesday said the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu may be well advised to take a decision about the continuance of V Senthil Balaji (who is in judicial custody) as a Minister without portfolio in the state cabinet, as it serves no purpose and does not augur well with the principles of Constitutional ethos on goodness, good governance and purity in administration.The first bench comprising Chief Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice PD Audikesavalu made the observation while disposing of two quo warranto petitions filed by advocate Ramachandran and former AIADMK MP J Jayavardhan and a PIL from advocate ML Ravi.\"The present petition brings to the fore the erosion of the high standards of characters and conduct demanded from the Members of the Legislature. The petitioners expect and legitimately so, high standards of moral conduct by the persons in power. The Chief Minister is the repository of the people's faith. Political compulsion cannot outweigh the public morality, requirements of good/clean governance and the Constitutional morality\", the bench added.The bench said, \"A Minister is a people's representative and as a Minister is conferred with Legislative and Executive powers, the business of the Government is performed in consonance with the Business Rules by a Minister only with respect to the portfolio assigned to him. With the Cabinet System of Governance, the entire Cabinet is responsible for its collective decisions, so also for its individual Ministerial decisions.\"\"The Ministers without portfolios do not have any specific Ministries, nor they do have carved out responsibilities. The Chief Minister is an Executive Head. It is the responsibility of an Executive Head to assign Ministerial responsibilities to an elected representative. However, if he feels that a particular elected representative cannot be assigned the responsibility of a Minister, there cannot be moral or Constitutional basis to retain such a Member of the Legislative Assembly as a Minister without portfolio, which would be opposed to the ethos, good Governance and Constitutional morality or integrity,\" the bench said.Citing a judgment of the Supreme Court, the bench said the top court in the said judgment, expected the Prime Minister or the Chief Ministers may be well advised to consider avoiding any person in the Council of Ministers, against whom charges have been framed by a Criminal Court in respect of offences involving moral turpitude and also offences specifically referred to in Chapter III of the Act of 1951. Chapter III of Part II of the Act of 1951 includes the offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 also.The bench said it was the contention of the petitioners that if the Minister was under custody, then in that case he has disabled himself from performing any work.The Minister enjoys the perks and allowances at the cost of the public exchequer and a person in custody cannot perform any work nor files can be sent to him and as such, though he was disabled from functioning as a Minister, he was burdening the public exchequer. Nor can he transact any business and as such, the person cannot continue as a Minister.This argument was based more on the concern of pubic morality or Constitutional morality. Naturally, the person in custody cannot effectively perform the work of a Minister.\"In the present case, V Senthil Balaji is a Minister without Portfolio, meaning thereby, no work is allotted to him. He is a Minister for the namesake. In other words, a Minister without any work. Such a person certainly will not be entitled for any allowances because he will not be officiating any work nor any work is allotted to him. Certainly, no purpose is served by just ceremonially retaining him as a Minister\", the bench added.Referring to the submission relating to Governor exercising his discretion, the bench said if the Governor chooses to 'withdraw his pleasure' in respect of a Minister, he must exercise his discretion with the knowledge of the Chief Minister and not unilaterally. In the present case, the Chief Minister had never consented for the exercise of discretion by the Governor, the bench added.Referring to the submission relating to disqualification of Senthil Balaji, the bench said in the absence of any statutory disqualification incurred by him, it would not be permissible for the Court to issue certain directions to the Governor to take a decision in a particular manner.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMore over, it would also be a matter of debate as to whether the Governor can unilaterally disqualify a person officiating as a Minister, though he has not incurred any disqualification under the Constitution of India or under any statute, the bench added.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "India is hosting the annual G20 Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10.Washington:It is for China to decide what role it plays at the G20 Summit in New Delhi, a top US official has said, asserting that if Beijing wants to come in and be a \"spoiler\", that option is available to it.US National Security Advisor Sullivan was responding to a question at a White House news conference on Tuesday on the impact of India-China border tensions on the G20 Summit.\"As far as the question of tensions between India and China affecting the (G20) summit - really that's up to China. If China wants to come in and play the role of spoiler, of course, that option is available to them,\" he said.\"What I think the Chair, India, will encourage them to do what we, the United States and every other member, virtually every other member of the G20 will do, is encourage them to come in, in a constructive way on climate, on multilateral development, bank reform, on debt relief, on technology and set aside the geopolitical questions and really focus on problem-solving and delivering for the developing countries,\" Mr Sullivan said.Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the G20 Summit in New Delhi this week and the delegation will be led by Premier Li Qiang, China's foreign ministry announced on Monday as it expressed Beijing's readiness to work with all parties to make the high-profile meeting a success.At the invitation of the Government of India, Premier of the State Council Li will attend the 18th G20 Summit to be held in New Delhi, India on September 9 and 10, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said in a brief statement.India is hosting the annual G20 Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10.At the G-20 Summit, Mr Sullivan said President Joe Biden will be clear that the United States expects real progress.\"He will be clear that we need all G20 members to be constructive and at the table, with no exceptions. We'll also be making progress on other key priorities, from climate to health to digital technology, including commitments, with respect to a more inclusive digital transformation and a responsible path and approach to AI development,\" he noted.\"In addition, we'll spotlight the progress that we've been making on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment, or what we call PGI. We'll have some announcements that we're excited about. Now, we know that there will be continued focus on how the G20 deals with Russia's illegal and ongoing war in Ukraine,\" he said.Mr Sullivan said the reality is that Russia's illegal war has devastated social and economic consequences, and the poorest countries on the planet are bearing the brunt of it.As he has done before, President Biden will call for a just and durable peace founded in respect for international law, principles of the UN Charter, the precepts of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he said.Mr Sullivan said Biden will continue to emphasise that the United States will support Ukraine for as long as it takes to redeem these principles.\"Last but not least, and this is important, you'll see that the United States will make it clear that we remain committed to the G20, as a critical forum for all of the major economies of the world to come together for global problem-solving,\" he told reporters.At a moment when the international economy is suffering from historic and overlapping shocks, it is more important than ever to have a working forum with the world's largest economies to deliver meaningful outcomes, Mr Sullivan said.\"So, in a sign of that commitment, the United States is looking forward to hosting the G20 in 2026,\" he said.Meanwhile, an eminent American expert said on Tuesday that Chian's decision to skip the G20 Summit in New Delhi points to a troubled state of India-China relations.Asia Society Vice President for International Security and Diplomacy Daniel Russel said Xi recently travelled to South Africa to attend a BRICS summit in person.\"So, his decision to skip this week's G-20 in New Delhi is significant,\" Russel said.\"The tensions between Delhi and Beijing, and the apparent animosity between the two leaders, seems the likeliest explanation - but we do not know. Not even offering an alibi makes it look like Xi Jinping is snubbing Modi - it points to the troubled state of PRC-Indian relations,\" he said.It is true that Chinese premier will substitute, but Li lacks the stature of past Chinese prime ministers like Zhu Rongzhi who wielded significant decision-making on economic matters, he added.\"Xi Jinping's rationale is less clear, but the signalling from Beijing suggests that he is keeping Biden at arm's length - and making no commitment to attend the November APEC Summit in San Francisco - in an attempt to pressure Washington into making concessions such as easing export restrictions on advanced semiconductors and equipment,\" he said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Ironically, the absence of Putin and Xi leaves the field open to Biden to dominate the agenda as well as the airwaves. He can be expected to press for stronger measures against Russia, on clean energy transition, and on measures to deal with crushing debt among developing nations - the vast amount of which is held by China,\" Russel said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Ms Kamboj's remarks were a veiled reference to China and its friend Pakistan. (File)United Nations:India has told the UN Security Council that blocking evidence-based proposals for blacklisting globally sanctioned terrorists without giving justifications is uncalled for and \"smacks of doublespeak\", a thinly-veiled reference to China and Pakistan. The working methods of the UNSC Sanctions Committees continue to dent the credibility of the UN Security Council, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj said here on Tuesday.Speaking in the Security Council's open debate on Working Methods, Kamboj said \"genuine, evidence-based listing proposals for globally sanctioned terrorists to be blocked without giving any due justification is uncalled for and smacks of doublespeak when it comes to Council's commitment in tackling the challenge of terrorism. She stressed that the working methods of Sanctions Committees must emphasise transparency, and objectivity in listing and delisting and should not be based on political considerations.Kamboj's remarks were a veiled reference to China and its all-weather friend Pakistan.Beijing has repeatedly placed holds and blocks on bids by India and its allies to list Pakistan-based terrorists.The latest example came in June this year when China blocked a proposal by India and the US under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council to designate Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Sajid Mir, wanted for his involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, as a global terrorist.Kamboj highlighted that India, an eight-term elected member of the UNSC, has some key concerns about the need to improve the working methods of the Security Council. What we need is a Security Council that better reflects the geographical and developmental diversity of the United Nations today. A Security Council where voices of developing countries and unrepresented regions, including Africa, Latin America and the vast majority of Asia and Pacific, find their due place at this horseshoe table, she said.India, the world's most populous nation, underscored that an expansion of the Council in both categories of membership is absolutely essential. This is the only way to bring the Council's composition and decision-making dynamics in line with contemporary geo-political realities, Kamboj said.She added that the international community can no longer hide behind the smokescreen of the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) in the General Assembly and continue to pay lip service by continuing to deliver statements in a process that has no time frame, no text and no defined goal to achieve. If countries are truly interested in making the Council more accountable and more credible, we call on them to come out openly and support a clear pathway to achieve this reform in a time-bound manner, through the only established process in the UN, which is by engaging in negotiations based on text and not through speaking at each other, or past each other, as we have done for the last three decades, she said.Kamboj underlined that as the threats to international peace and security evolve, so must this Council. We ask those blocking progress on this vital issue to heed the calls for genuine reform, and contribute to making this Council truly fit for purpose for the 21st century. She noted that merely fixing the working methods of the Security Council will never be good enough to rectify its fundamental flaw, its lack of representative character. To continue to deny member states of the Global South a voice and role in Council's decision-making only lowers the Council's credibility, she said.Another area of concern highlighted by India was that the selection of chairs of subsidiary bodies and distribution of penholderships must be made through a process that is open, transparent, based on exhaustive consultations, and with a more integrated perspective. The consensus of E-10 on chairs of subsidiary bodies to be assumed by the E-10 themselves must be honoured by the P5. For the P5 to decide, even in the 21st century, as to what roles should go eventually to the E-10, reflects a continuation of the mindset of the post-1945 era: to the victors belong the spoils. This is simply unacceptable, she said.The Security Council has five permanent members the United States, China, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom collectively known as the P5.The ten elected members of the Security Council are commonly referred to as the E10.She also pointed to the obsoleteness and irrelevance of some UNSC agenda items, asserting that there are items on the agenda of the Security Council on which discussions have not taken place since the UN's creation.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com There is a case for beginning a discussion into the review of items on the list of matters of which the Council is seized, she said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The move, that comes days ahead of the special session of parliament, has sent political temperatures soaring.Here are the top 10 updates on this big story\"Bharat\" has also been used in a G20 booklet meant for foreign delegates titled - \"Bharat, The Mother Of Democracy\". \"Bharat is the official name of the country. It is mentioned in the Constitution as also in the discussions of 1946-48,\" the booklet says.Thismarks a significant shift in nomenclatureon the international stage as the country prepares to host US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other top world leaders.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra last night also shared a document on the PM's visit to Indonesia that referred to him as the \"Prime Minister of Bharat.\" The identity cards of Indian officials at the G20 Summit on September 9 and 10 will also now say 'Bharat - Official'.Sources say the government may put forward a resolution to change the country's name later this month in the five-day special session of parliament that starts on September 18. The fact that the government has not announced any agenda for the special session has only added to the speculation.The move drew scathing criticism from the Opposition. The members of the Opposition INDIA bloc accused the Narendra Modi government of \"distorting history and dividing India\".They linked the government move to the formation of their alliance. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal asked whether the ruling party would change the country's name to 'BJP' if the opposition alliance decided to call itself \"Bharat\".Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said no one has the right to change the country's name. \"I don't understand why the ruling party is perturbed over a name (INDIA bloc) related to the country,\" the NCP chief said.BJP leaders, however, welcomed the \"Bharat\" nomenclature and accused the Opposition of being anti-national and anti-constitutional. They said the term \"Bharat\" is also in Article 1 of the Constitution, which says: \"India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.\"Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the decision to use 'Bharat' is a big statement against the colonial mindset. \"This should have happened earlier.

So, you had some occasions where you had a president or two, sometimes three, who have not themselves come,\" the minister said.My sense from talking to the ministers, certainly, and I know the Sherpas are in touch with each other, they are right now trying to hammer out the final document. I think everybody is coming with a great deal of seriousness,\" he added.Mr Jaishankar was asked if President Putin and President Xi not being present will cast a shadow on the New Delhi G20 Summit being held on September 9 and 10.\"I do not think it has anything to do with India. I. I think whatever decision they make, they would know best,\" Mr Jaishankar said in response to another query.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Monday that Premier Li Qiang will attend the 18th G20 Summit in New Delhi. It gave no reason for Xi Jinping's absence from the summit.President Putin, in a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, had conveyed his inability to attend the G20 Summit in New Delhi and informed that Russia would be represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.Asked about any impact on the outcome of the summit, Mr Jaishankar said that the issues being taken up are not new.\"I would put it this way, the issues are there. These are not issues that are this morning being taken up, I mean there is a whole gestation period of eight-nine months, where at different levels ministers or officials have tried to progress an issue. So, this is like a culmination. These are really about 16-18 processes which are all coming together to be stitched up together to produce a summit,\" he said.\"Well, we are negotiating right now. As I said the negotiation is not...the clock did not start ticking yesterday, the clock has been ticking for some time, so typically what happens is there is a ministerial meeting. Then a ministerial meeting produces outcomes,\" he added.Asked about consensus building and what will India see as a win-win situation, Mr Jaishankar said it is just not a matter of India seeing something.\"Today the expectations of the world are very high in terms of what the G20 is able to produce and produce in terms of meeting the challenges of the world. So, if you were to go to Africa, go to Latin America, go to parts of Asia, go to the Caribbean, and go to the Pacific, everybody is today saying, okay I have a certain set of issues. I have a debt problem, I have a trade problem, I have a health access problem, I have a green development resourcing problem. So, what will the G20 do for me? So, the world is waiting,\" he said.He said there are a lot of issues for G20 and one of the important messages is to focus on the Global South.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"You are going to get really a mix of issues that the world is looking at and a lot of this, the burden is on the Global South, on developing countries.

Photos of PM Modi are lining streets across the capital New Delhi to welcome world leaders to the summit, the most powerful gathering India has ever hosted.Here's how authorities have rolled out the red carpet.Rooftop snipers and 'Black Cats'Security operations involve tens of thousands of security personnel, including rooftop snipers and anti-drone technology.India's counter-terrorism \"Black Cats\" guards have been practising rapid deployments from helicopters, rappelling down ropes onto hotel roofs where presidents will be staying.Traffic police have promised \"elaborate regulations\" with a huge restricted zone slapped across much of the city centre, and bullet-proof limousines will ferry visiting leaders.Businesses have been ordered shut and a holiday declared -- meaning normally jam-packed streets and their ubiquitous honking motorised rickshaws will fall silent.The summit takes place in Bharat Mandapam, a recently revamped conference centre in delhi's Pragati Maidan.The sprawling riverside site lies close to the towers of the 16th century Mughal-era Purana Qila fort, as well to Raj Ghat where G20 leaders are expected to plant trees.Clean-up driveDelhi, home to around 30 million people, has been on an intense beautification drive since India assumed the G20 presidency last year.More than 4,000 homeless people living under bridges and on roadsides in the city centre have been moved into \"shelter homes\" ahead of the summit, according to municipal officials.Several long-closed fountains are running again, while roadside markings that faded years ago are gleaming with a fresh lick of paint.Some 70,000 flower pots have been set out across the city. Maintaining and monitoring the foliage has become a major task in itself, with 35 water tankers deployed to keep the plants green, the Times of India reported.Statues have popped up across the city centre, including a 28-foot-tall (8.5-metre-tall) figure of the Hindu god Shiva at the G20 summit venue entrance.Monkey-men and mosquitofishA team of more than 30 \"monkey-men\" have been deployed and primate cutouts erected to deter marauding monkeys from munching on floral displays laid out for global leaders.Monkeys are a major menace in the city, often trashing gardens, offices and residential rooftops and even viciously attacking people for food.The men mimic the hoots and screams of the aggressive langur monkey -- the natural enemy of the smaller rhesus macaque primates that wreak havoc in the national capital's central areas.Officials however halted a bid to solve another city challenge -- to round up and hide thousands of stray dogs -- after the canine-catching scheme sparked anger from Delhi residents and animal rights activists.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comEight teams equipped with insecticide sprayers are dousing likely mosquito-breeding sites across the G20 venue, the Hindustan Times reported.

Mr Radhakrishna's father, master sculptor Devasenapathy Sthapati, is known for making Chola bronze sculptures, including at Rajarajeshwari temple in Delhi's Janakpuri.It has been constructed using the lost-wax casting method to make finely detailed single piece sculptures. This process ensures there are no welded parts in the Nataraja statue.More than 100 artists spent nearly 3.25 lakh man hours to complete the different processes involved in the lost-wax casting method to create the hollow statue.The statue was finished at the cost of approximately Rs 10-12 crore ahead of theG20 summit, said Sachchidanand Joshi, member secretary, IGNCA.Post a comment",

The Opposition has slammed the BJP-led government at the Centre, accusing it of rebranding India only for political reasons.How India Got Its NameNot many are aware that the name Bharat wasn't in the first draft of the Indian Constitution when it was introduced by Dr B R Ambedkar, the Chairman of the drafting committee, on November 4, 1948. In fact, it wasn't until a year later when the finalisation of the Constitution approached that the omission of the native name was underlined by many people.Following this, on September 18, 1949, Dr. Ambedkar moved an amendment to draft Article 1, which read, \"India, that is, Bharat shall be a Union of States.\" The phraseology came under criticism from assembly member HV Kamath, who called it \"clumsy and a constitutional error\".Heated Debate And AlternativesHV Kamaththen offered two alternatives: \"Bharat, or, in the English language, India, shall be a Union of States\" or \"Hind, or, in the English language, India, shall be a Union of States.\" He said that the phrase \"in the English language, India\" was critical, for in many countries, the nation was still known as \"Hindustan,\" and its people were referred to as Hindus regardless of their faith.A heated discussion ensued with several members of the Constituent Assembly registering their disapproval of the name India and arguing in favour of Bharat. For instance, Seth Govind Das from Jabalpur backed HV Kamath saying, India, that is, Bharat weren't the most pleasing words for the name of a country, adding it should be, Bharat known as India also in foreign countries .To draw his point home, HV Kamath referred to the Irish constitution and how the lawmakers named their country. The Constitution of the Irish Free State reads: The name of the State is Eire, or, in the English language, Ireland, HV Kamath said.While Seth Govind Das Das argued that Vishnu Purana and Brahma Purana mentioned Bharat, other members claimed that the seventh-century Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang also called the country Bharat and not India. Many also said that India wasn't an ancient word, unlike Bharat, which epitomised the history and culture of this civilisation.Hargovind Pant, who represented the United Provinces, said that he failed to understand why the word 'Bharat Varsha' was not acceptable to the House when \"the importance and glory of this word is being admitted by all here\".The VotePromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comDespite reservations over the name, India, and some strong arguments favouring Bharat, HV Kamath's amendment was rejected by a vote of 38 ayes to 51 noes.

        "text": "The Election Commission is ready work as per legal provisions, the Chief Eelection Commissioner said.Bhopal:The Election Commission of India is ready to work as per constitutional provisions and the Representative of the People (RP) Act, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar said today in the context of 'one nation, one election'.Mr Kumar and other top ECI officials were on a visit to Bhopal to hold meetings with political parties and the administration and enforcement agencies over election preparedness in BJP-governed Madhya Pradesh, where polls are due by November.The final voters' list will be published on October 5, he said. The state has nearly 5.5 crore voters, he said.Responding to a question on the concept of 'one nation, one election, the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) said that the poll commission is required to \"deliver elections before the time\" as per constitutional provisions and the RP Act.This time, according to legal provisions, is five years from the date of the first sitting of Parliament after a new government is formed. The ECI can announce the general elections six months before the end of this time, Mr Kumar said. The norms are similar for assembly elections.The Election Commission of India is mandated and ready to deliver elections as per legal provisions, he said.The Centre last week formed a high-level committee under former president Ram Nath Kovind to explore the feasibility of holding simultaneous polls to the Lok Sabha, state assemblies and local bodies, bringing 'one nation, one election, under the spotlight.To a question about e-voting, CEC said it will take time as the process is vulnerable to hacking and also has trust issues.Technology is not an issue and the current process is not connected to a network but \"discussion on this (e-voting) is going on and it will take time to evolve\", he said.The final voters' list for MP polls will be published on October 5, said Mr Kumar and urged new eligible voters to get enrolled and apply for correction if they find any discrepancies in their data.Asked about the possibility of \"misuse of online transactions\" in the run-up to polls, the CEC said financial institutions are told to keep a watch on suspicious and bulk transactions and alert authorities concerned.Madhya Pradesh has 5.52 crore voters, including 2.85 crore male and 2.67 female electors. The state also has 1,336 transgender persons, 4.85 lakh people with disabilities, 7.12 lakh voters aged above 80 years, 6,180 people who are more than 100 years old, 18.86 lakh new voters and 75,426 service voters.Mr Kumar said ECI is putting in place a system to enable senior citizens and persons with disabilities to vote from their homes in the upcoming polls if they apply for the same.Such voters can request through an online form to vote from home, he said. Election officials will visit the homes of such voters and ensure voting with confidentiality and also videograph the process in the presence of political parties' representatives, he said.The poll commission is also making efforts to increase voting percentage and ensure the participation of women, new voters and other vulnerable tribal groups, he said.Asked about the current expenses of candidates whose names have already been announced by their parties, Mr Kumar said as per legal provisions, a candidate is needed to keep a tab of their expenditure from the date of nomination till the polling day.BJP has already announced 39 candidates in Madhya Pradesh, which has 230 assembly seats.About freebies, the CEC said political parties have the right to inform voters about what they are offering to the electors but they also need to spell out the timeline of fulfilling the promise, the expenditure to be incurred on it and the arrangement of funds.ECI has made a detailed report in this regard but the issue of freebies in polls is sub-judice with the matter reaching the Supreme Court, he said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIn reply to another question, he said jail inmates are not allowed to vote as per the law.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Ethnic violence broke out on May 3 in Manipur (File)New Delhi:In a relief to four members of the Editors Guild of India (EGI), the Supreme Court Wednesday directed the Manipur police not to take any coercive steps against them till September 11 in connection with two FIRs lodged for offences including promoting enmity between two communities.On September 4, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh had said a police case had been filed on the basis of a complaint against the president and three members of the Editors Guild of India and accused them of trying to \"provoke clashes\" in the state.A second FIR was also registered against the four members of the Guild, with the additional charge of defamation.\"Till next date of listing, no coercive step shall be taken against the (four) petitioners in connection with the FIRs...,\" a bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra ordered after a brief hearing.The top court also sought the response of the state government on the plea filed by the Guild and fixed the matter for hearing on Monday.Initially, the bench was of the view that it will protect the EGI members against possible coercive State action for a limited period and, in the meantime, they can move the Manipur High Court for relief.However, the bench later kept the case to itself after hearing senior advocate Shyam Divan who appeared for the journalists' body.Giving details of the case, Divan said the Editors Guild had prepared a report after sending three of its members to the ground in Manipur.\"They (EGI members) went there for four days between August 7 and August 10, 2023 and they published a report. The report is dated September 2, 2023 and there was a small error in the report which was corrected immediately on September 3,\" he said.The senior lawyer said two FIRs were lodged on the basis of the report alleging that \"incorrect and false statements\" have been made in it which provokes enmity.\"This is why we are here and we are very seriously apprehending that this kind of coercive machinery may act against us,\" he said, adding even the chief minister made a statement at a press conference to allege EGI made \"provocative statements\". Taking note of submissions, the bench protected the EGI members till Monday.Earlier, the top court agreed to hear their plea, which was not listed, on an urgent basis during the day itself.The initial complaint against the EGI president and its three members was filed by Ngangom Sarat Singh, a retired engineer who had worked for the state government.The second FIR was lodged by Sorokhaibam Thoudam Sangita of Khurai in Imphal East district.Besides EGI president Seema Mustafa, those who have been booked are senior journalists Seema Guha, Bharat Bhushan and Sanjay Kapoor. They visited the state between August 7 and 10 to study media reportage on the ethnic violence.The Editors Guild, in a report published on September 2, slammed the internet ban in the state as being detrimental to media reportage, criticised what it termed as one-sided reporting by some media outlets and claimed there were indications that the state leadership had \"turned partisan\" during the conflict.\"They are anti-state, anti-national and anti-establishment (people) who came to pour venom. Had I known it before, I would not have allowed them to enter,\" the chief minister had said.The EGI said in its report it received several representations about media in Manipur playing a partisan role in the ongoing ethnic conflict between the Meitei and Kuki-Chin communities.\"There are clear indications that the leadership of the state became partisan during the conflict. It should have avoided taking sides in the ethnic conflict but it failed to do its duty as a democratic government which should have represented the entire state,\" the report said.In normal circumstances, the EGI said, reports filed by journalists are cross-checked and monitored by their editors or chiefs of bureau with the local administration, police and security forces, but this was not possible during the conflict.\"The internet ban made matters worse. Communication blockade by the government had a deleterious effect on journalism as it directly impacted the ability of journalists to communicate with each other, their editors and their sources. It also impacted the media because local news gathered without any communication links was not sufficient to give a balanced view of the situation,\" the report said.With the internet suspended, and communication and transport in disarray, the media had to rely almost entirely on the narrative of the state government, it said.The EGI said members of the state leadership labelled sections of the Kuki-Zo tribals as \"illegal immigrants\" and \"foreigners\" without any reliable data or evidence.\"This despite the fact that the decadal census from 1901 to 2011 has not shown any unusual growth of the non-Naga (the other minority tribal community) tribal population,\" the report said.The Editors' Guild members were booked under various sections of the IPC including 153A (promoting enmity between two communities), 200 (using false declaration as true), 298 (deliberate intent to wound religious feelings), and under provisions of the Information Technology Act and Press Council Act.The second FIR, besides these charges, also has Section 499 (defamation) of IPC added to it.The Manipur government had earlier filed an FIR against a three-member fact-finding team of the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) for a report on the ethnic conflict.More than 160 people have lost their lives and several hundreds injured since the ethnic clashes broke out in Manipur on May 3, after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMeiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley.

        "text": "Pulwama:National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Wednesday said the opposition INDIA bloc is ready to change its name if it has triggered the Centre's push for Bharat instead of India.His remarks came after invitations for a G20 dinner sent out by President Droupadi Murmu, describing her position as 'President of Bharat' instead of the customary 'President of India', triggered a massive furore on Tuesday with the opposition alleging that the Narendra Modi government is planning to drop India and stay with just Bharat as the country's name.\"If the trigger is the opposition parties naming their alliance INDIA, we will change our (alliance) name. We don't want to put the nation in trouble. We are not here to increase the expenditure of the nation, but to reduce it. If we get a slight hint that it is being done because the alliance's name is INDIA, we will change our name, Mr Abdullah told reporters.Mr Abdullah said while both India and Bharat were mentioned as the names of the country in the Constitution, the former should not be dropped from the statute. It is written in our Constitution. Both names are there, we use both names. If you look at the aircraft of the prime minister in which he is going to Indonesia today, both names are inscribed on it - India as well as Bharat,\" the former chief minister said.\"If the prime minister, for some reason, does not want to use the name India, let him not. But it (India) should not be removed from the Constitution and it should be left to our choice, he added.Mr Abdullah also questioned the rationale behind the preference being given to Bharat instead of India. If you decide to remove it (India), from where will you remove it? Will the name of the State Bank of India change? Will the name of ISRO, which recently completed the Chandrayaan-3 mission successfully, change? IIT, IIM and how many more institutions' names will you change? he asked.Asked about the special session of parliament scheduled later this month, Mr Abdullah said, There is no agenda for the special session of parliament. Had there been an agenda, we would have spoken about it.\" \"As far as One Nation, One Election' is concerned, committees have been formed earlier as well at least four or five times. Now this is a new committee, what is the purpose, we do not know.\"If the aim is to make the process easier, then no one should have problems with it. But if you are trying to finish the regional parties by One Nation, One Election,' then we are strongly against it. If the aim is to harm the federal structure of the country, we are against it as well. No one will support this if the aim is one nation, no election, he added.Reacting to the prime minister's statement on economic growth and political stability, Mr Abdullah said the dividends of the growth were not visible on the ground. The growth has been there earlier as well and much higher. Today, there is room for more growth but we do not see adequate effects of the growth on the ground. Unemployment, inflation and agricultural distress are on the rise in the country. You might give the data of growth but the benefits that the youth should get from it are not there, he added.Meanwhile, PDP spokesperson Mohit Bhan said the controversy around India being renamed as Bharat was a diversionary tactic. Whether you call it India or Bharat, the poverty remains the same, the inflation remains the same, corruption is still there. There is no difference between the two. The situation that the country is going through - be it unemployment, corruption, inflation or the atmosphere of hate in Manipur and Nuh (Haryana) - will not change by calling the country Bharat,\" Bhan said in Srinagar.\"The basic issues which could have caught the attention of the G20 delegates have been smartly sidelined by the government. Our appeal to the people is that they should raise questions on the basic issues, Bhan said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comHe said as far as the constitutional validity is concerned, We have seen that the constituent assembly passed the name after a lot of deliberations and discussions. Bhan said even One Nation, One Election' was just a slogan as there is no draft so far. Again it is a diversion from main issues on which the government has failed in the past nine years, he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Issues and work are discussed.\" the minister wrote.The suspense over the agenda has triggered speculation on the country's name change.

She said this is the \"direction\" of Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann.Punjab Congress chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring too said the party is gearing up to fight on all seats in the state.Both the parties are part of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) that is preparing to take on the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in 2024. But in Punjab, the Congress is the main rival to the AAP.Mr Warring said the state Congress unit is confident that the party's national leadership will not take any decision on Punjab \"without our consent\".The state unit has not been told by the party high command about any tie-up or seat sharing in Punjab, he told reporters here. \"We have been asked (by the party high command) to prepare for the 13 Lok Sabha seats,\" Warring said.AAP leader Gagan Mann made it clear that there will be no alliance with the Congress in Punjab.At the national level, many political parties have joined hands against the BJP to save democracy, she said but added that \"in Punjab, we have the responsibility of the state in Punjab, there will not be any kind of compromise.

Adding security personnel, media representatives, people involved in catering and others would mean that nearly 10,000 people will be at Bharat Mandapam on Saturday and Sunday, he said.India BilateralsMr Pardeshi said, as the host nation, India has received many requests for bilateral meetings, but PM Modi will also be chairing the sessions during the summit. He will receive the leaders individually on Saturday and reach the venue at 9 am.On the venue for the bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden, he said it will depend on the date and time.Big Dinner\"A world-class convention centre has been set up in the form of Bharat Mandapam.

The other officials will be seated in the viewing room, where they will have a live feed,\" said Mr Pardeshi.\"The gala dinner hosted by the President will take place at the multi-function hall, which has a huge capacity, There will be a short cultural programme accompanying the gala dinner,\" he added.Over 20 meeting rooms have been set aside for bilaterals and, based on the requests that are being received, a team headed by a joint secretary is making conferencing and other arrangements.Experiencing UPIThe G20 special secretary said digital experience zones are being created at Bharat Mandapam so that visiting leaders, delegates, ministers and media personnel can understand the progress India has made in the digital sector.He said India is very strong in the creation of digital public infrastructure like Aadhaar, CoWIN and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the \"developing south would like to learn from the Indian experience how technological transformation can enable socio-economic transformation in a country\".To ensure that the delegations can try out UPI, the Reserve Bank of India is setting up special zones where they can do so without being registered for it.\"Opportunity, Not Nightmare\"On whether making the arrangements has been a logistical challenge or a nightmare, the G20 special secretary said, \"I would say it is a logistical opportunity.

Maybe today also they are. But the very basis for being in a closet is largely opened up,\" the bench observed, adding the law has developed with time.\"Let us understand what they are doing. Ultimately, it is to protect the blood which has been obtained for needy people. There cannot be Article 14 (equality before law) issue in this,\" the bench said.When the petitioner's counsel referred to some data, the top court said they may be deceptive.The bench asked the counsel whether similar issue has been raised in another petition which is pending before the apex court.The lawyer responded in the affirmative.\"We are not issuing notice,\" the bench said, adding the plea will be tagged with the pending petition.While hearing the earlier petition in March 2021, the apex court had issued notices to the Centre, the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) and the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) seeking their responses on the plea filed by a transgender activist from Manipur.The petition has sought striking down the clause in the guidelines for blood donor selection and blood donor referral, 2017 to the extent that it permanently bars transgenders, men having sex with men and female sex workers from being donors as they were at risk of contracting HIV.\"The exclusion of transgender persons, men having sex with men and female sex workers from being blood donors and permanently prohibiting them from donating blood solely on the basis of their gender identity and sexual orientation is completely arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory and also unscientific,\" the plea filed in 2021 said.It alleged that transgender persons, gay and bisexual men, who were requesting for being allowed to donate blood during the Covid-19 pandemic, when their community and family members needed blood for emergency medical treatment, were turned away due to \"permanent deferral under the impugned guidelines\".PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIt claimed these guidelines are \"stigmatizing\" as they are neither based on how HIV transmissions actually happen nor on the actual risk involved in specific activities but on the sexual identity and orientation of donors.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The system is able to detect and locate moving elephants up to 5 metre from the fibre optical cable.Mr De said that there are 80 such elephant corridors in the Northeast region and considering the 100 per cent success rate of IDS, the zonal railway has decided to introduce it on other corridors as well and the Railway Ministry has sanctioned Rs 77 crore for it.The system was the brainchild of then General Manager of NFR Anshul Gupta, who came to know about this technology 13 years ago while he was on a visit to London.\"I experimented it twice, once in 2011 and then in 2016 in different railway divisions but its successful implementation took place only in December 2022 when we launched this project in the 11 corridors,\" Gupta, who retired in March 2023, said.After his superannuation, Rajiv Mahajan, who was the then Chief Administrative Officer of Project (Mechanical), monitored the project and executed it successfully.

The defining feature of the Indian 'model' of digitisation is the lead taken by the government and the Public Sector in building infrastructure, on top of which innovative products are created by private sector FinTech firms and startups,\" the RBI governor said.Citing the World Bank's Global Findex Database 2021, Das said that 76 per cent of adults worldwide had access to an account in a bank or a regulated financial institution as compared to 51 per cent in 2011.In comparison, the percentage of adults in India who have access to bank accounts increased from 35 per cent in 2011 to 78 per cent in 2021, he said.He said that 500 million Jan Dhan bank accounts have been opened in India since the launch of the Jan Dhan scheme by the government in 2014.During his address, Governor Das that the Unique Identification Authority of India had issued 1.35 billion Aadhaar identities as of November 30, 2022.\"This has also enabled FinTechs to offer paperless and contactless financial services. Aadhaar has enhanced customer convenience, strengthened the security of financial transactions and substantially mitigated the risk of identity fraud. It is a good example of how digitalPublic infrastructure can be leveraged to achieve public policy objectives,\" he said.Underscoring the role of mobile connectivity in the digitisation of financial services in India, Mr Das said the number of internet users in India has grown from about 70 million in 2014 to about 800 million in 2022.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"During the same period, the number of digital transactions in India grew from about 1.2 billion in 2014 to about 91 billion in 2022.

(File)Nagpur:Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Wednesday said that discrimination exists in our society, and reservations should continue as long as inequality persists.Speaking at an event in Nagpur, he also said the 'Akhand Bharat' or undivided India will become a reality before today's youngsters become old, as those who separated from India in 1947 are now feeling that they made a mistake.Incidentally, Mr Bhagwat's statement on reservations came at a time when the Maratha community's agitation for a quota has once again intensified.\"We kept our own fellow human beings behind in the social system. We did not care for them, and it continued for 2000 years. Until we provide them equality, some special remedies have to be there, and reservations is one of them. Hence, reservations have to continue till there is such discrimination. We at the RSS give all support to the reservations provided in the Constitution,\" he said.Discrimination exists in society even though we may not see it, he noted.Reservations are about \"giving respect\" and not just about ensuring financial or political equality, the RSS chief further said.If the sections of society which faced discrimination suffered for 2000 years, \"why cannot we (those who did not face discrimination) accept some trouble for 200 more years,\" he added.Replying to a question by a student, Mohan Bhagwat said he can not tell exactly when the Akhand Bharat will come into existence.\"But if you go on working for it, you will see it materialise before you get old. Because the conditions are becoming such that those who separated from India feel that they made a mistake. They feel that we should have been India again. They think that for becoming India they need to erase the lines on the map. But it is not so.

UPI, will help users make voice-enabled UPI payments via apps, telecom calls, and IoT devices in Hindi and English.It will soon be available in several other regional languages also.Hello! UPI has been divided into segments: Conversational Payments on UPI, BillPay Connect.Conversational payments underscores the emergence of a novel paradigm for human-machine interaction facilitated by AI-enabled transactions that will further deepen the reach and use of digital payments in the country, NPCI said in a statement.NPCI said it has partnered with AI4Bharat at IIT Madras, to co-develop Hindi and English payment language models.With BillPay Connect, Bharat BillPay introduced a nationalised number for bill payments across the country, NPCI said, adding that customers can conveniently fetch and pay their bills by sending a 'Hi' on the messaging app.Along with this, customers without smartphones or immediate mobile data access will be able to pay bills by giving a missed call as well, it said.Customers using this facility will receive a call immediately for verification and payment authorisation.Additionally, BillPay Connect offers Voice Assisted Bill Payments facility. Customers can also fetch and pay bills through voice commands on their smart home devices and get instant voice confirmation, it said.To expand access to credit, promote financial inclusion and innovation, NPCI has rolled out credit line on UPI.This will enable pre-sanctioned credit lines from banks via UPI and will revolutionise customer access to credit, fostering a more streamlined and digital banking ecosystem, NPCI said.With this, the process of availing, connecting, and utilising credit lines will be significantly expedited, driving economic growth and progress, it said.The initiative has several key features, including linking pre-sanctioned credit lines, creation of digital credit products by banks, establishment of interest-free credit periods and corresponding interest rates, defined schedule of charges, customer engagement channels for credit sanction requests, and the ability to link various pre-sanctioned credit lines via UPI-enabled apps for transactions, it stated.To ensure seamless interoperability, all UPI apps, including bank and third-party ones, will be empowered to discover and link credit lines on UPI, as well as provide end-to-end customer lifecycle services, it said.Building on the success of UPI LITE feature, UPI LITE X was launched for offline payments.Through this feature, users can send and receive money, while being offline, allowing users to execute transactions even in areas with poor connectivity, NPCI said.UPI LITE X will be accessible to anyone with a compatible device that supports Near Field Communication (NFC), offering payments faster than other payment methods, as they require less time to process the transaction.In a significant move towards enhancing QR code and NFC technology adoption, UPI Tap & Pay has been rolled out, NPCI said, adding that in addition to the conventional scan-and-pay method, users will now have the option to simply tap NFC-enabled QR codes at merchant locations to complete their payments.The launch took place in the presence of Advisor to NPCI and Infosys Non-Executive Chairman Nandan Nilekani and Non-Executive Chairman of NPCI Biswamohan Mahapatra.The launches aligned with the RBI communique in its recent monetary policy announcements, the NPCI said.Terming the NPCI as the \"crown jewel\" of India's technology sector, Mr Nilekani said it has far exceeded expectations.The structure of NPCI was set up by the RBI in 2008 as a non-profit company for payments.\"It has set the stage for national information utilities.

        "text": "The Delhi High Court noted that the couple has been living separately for the last 27 years. (File)New Delhi:There can be no greater cruelty than making false allegations against the \"chastity\" of a woman, the Delhi High Court Wednesday observed while granting divorce decree to a woman on the grounds of cruelty and desertion noting that the couple has been living separately for the last 27 years.The high court said the term \"mental cruelty\" is wide enough to take within its ambit the \"financial instability\", and added that financial instability is bound to result in mental anxiety on account of husband not being settled in any business or profession and can be termed as a constant source of mental cruelty to the wife.\"It emerges that 'mental cruelty' cannot be defined in any straight jacket parameter. The circumstances and the situation of the spouses have to be considered to ascertain if certain acts, which are complained of, would be a source of mental agony and pain.\"In the present case, it is easy to decipher the mental trauma as the appellant (woman) was working and the respondent (husband) was not working. There was a huge disparity in the financial status of the appellant and the respondent. The endeavours of the respondent to be able to sustain himself had admittedly failed,\" a bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna said.The woman approached the high court challenging a family court's decision dismissing her plea to grant a divorce decree on the grounds of cruelty and desertion.The woman said in her plea that the man had started levelling allegations against her of having illicit relationship with her brother-in-law and many other persons.The court noted that the husband has vaguely replied that there was constant interference of her brother-in-law and other family members and said this lends credence to the woman's testimony.\"There can be no greater cruelty than making false allegations against the chastity of a woman,\" it said.The bench observed that a dead relationship only brings pain and agony and \"we find that the court cannot be a party to perpetuation of such mental cruelty\".\"The marriage ties which if kept lingering on account of irreconcilable differences and protracted litigation, only bring more cruelty and acrimony. Therefore, such a situation of separation of more than 27 years since December, 1996 is a ground for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty. We, therefore, hold that the appellant is entitled to divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,\" the high court said.The couple got married in 1989 and no child was born to them and they parted ways in 1996.The woman submitted that she was working with a multi-national company prior to her marriage and it was represented to her that the man was a Delhi University graduate and was earning Rs 10,000 per month from different sources. It was represented that the man's family has a good financial status and position and they owned a two and a half storey bungalow in Delhi.However, after the marriage, she came to know that the man was not a graduate and not working in any concern and he also had no job and the only money he used to get was from his mother.The man denied all the allegations levelled against him, including that of dowry demands and cruelty.The high court said the very fact that the parties have been living separately since November 1996 and no conciliation has taken place for the past about 27 years, proves that the parties were unable to sustain their matrimonial relationship.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comFor a couple to be deprived of each other's company and of conjugal relationship can be interpreted only as amounting to mental cruelty, it said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The march saw participation from a cross-section of society, including film and TV celebrities such as Kamal Haasan, Pooja Bhatt, Riya Sen, Swara Bhasker, Rashami Desai, Akanksha Puri and Amol Palekar.Besides, writers and military veterans, including former Army chief Gen (Retd) Deepak Kapoor and ex-Navy chief Admiral (Retd) L Ramdas, and noted people such as former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan and ex-finance secretary Arvind Mayaram had also participated in the yatra.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOpposition leaders such as National Conference's Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah, PDP's Mehbooba Mufti, Shiv Sena's Aaditya Thackeray, Priyanka Chaturvedi and Sanjay Raut and NCP's Supriya Sule, had also walked alongside Gandhi at various points in time during the march.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

World leaders have also begun arriving.Here are 10 points in this developing story:With less than 12 hours to go until thetraffic restrictionskick in, the Delhi Police is gearing up for a hectic four days, even as most people living or working in the New Delhi District are looking forward to a forced long weekend. Heavy, medium and light goods vehicles will not be allowed to enter Delhi from 9 pm today till midnight on Sunday. The same restrictions will apply to taxis and autos from 5 am on Saturday.A gazette notification by the Delhi government said the entire area of New Delhi District will be considered a \"Controlled Zone\" from tomorrow morning till Sunday. Only bona fide residents, authorised vehicles and vehicles involved in services such as housekeeping, catering, waste management for hotels, hospitals and other important installations in the district will be allowed to travel to India Gate, C-Hexagon and other such areas.All cloud kitchens, commercial establishments, markets, food delivery, and commercial delivery services will be shut from tomorrow to Sunday. Deliveries from services like Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon and Flipkart will not be allowed in the controlled zone, but those of medicines and essential items will.The arrival ofworld leadersbegan on Tuesday, with the Nigerian delegation. The Mexican and European Union delegations are expected to reach New Delhi today, but the bulk of the arrivals will happen tomorrow, including those of US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau.TheG20 Summitwill be the first time India will host such a powerful group of leaders from across the globe and the security cordon will consist of thousands of personnel, including snipers. Indian Air Force fighter planes will be on standby and the airspace over the national capital will be monitored for all suspicious activity, including unmanned aerial vehicles and drones.Another, albeit different, layer of security will be provided by langur cutouts and mosquito larva-eating fish. Monkeys have become a menace in parts of the city - including Lutyens' Delhi - and several reports have emerged of the animals attacking and biting people. To combat this, over a dozen langur cutouts have been strategically placed in affected areas. Nearly 40 trained people, who can mimic the sounds of langurs to scare away the monkeys, will also be deployed.Eight teams equipped with insecticide sprayers are dousing likely mosquito-breeding sites across the G20 venue, theHindustan Timesreported. An official said that batches of larvae-eating mosquitofish were released ahead of the conference into around 180 lakes and fountain pools.Authorities have planted nearly 7 lakh flowering and foliage plants in different plants of Delhi. About 15,000 metric tonnes of solid waste have been cleared, and over 100 sculptures and 150 fountains with different designs have been installed at various locations to give the city an aesthetic look.Speaking to NDTV, G20 Special Secretary (Operations) Muktesh Pardeshi said that, as the host nation, India has received many requests for bilateral meetings. Prime Minister Narendra Modiwill receivethe world leaders individually at Bharat Mandapam in Pragati Maidan, which is the venue of the summit, on Saturday.Digital experience zones are being created at Bharat Mandapam so that visiting leaders, delegates, ministers and media personnel can understand the progress India has made in the digital sector, Mr Pardeshi said. To ensure that members of the delegations can try out UPI, the Reserve Bank of India is setting up special zones where they can do so without being registered for it.Post a comment",

        "text": "As the world's most powerful leaders descend on New Delhi for the Group of 20 summit, India is pulling out all the stops, deploying fighter jets around the capital, painting murals on underpasses and chasing away packs of monkeys from government buildings.The moment is a long-awaited milestone for India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is selling the nation as an emerging superpower with the clout to navigate geopolitical tensions, economic slowdowns and rising food and energy prices. Over the weekend, he'll test that thesis by welcoming US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other heads-of-state for one of the most important global gatherings of the year.But pulling off a successful G-20 summit is about more than smart diplomacy. For months, Indian officials have plotted out the best way to fortify Delhi, a city of more than 20 million people.At the heart of the project is locking down New Delhi district, the city's bureaucratic center, where the summit will take place Saturday and Sunday. The area is known for its acres of manicured parks, sandstone monuments and stately bungalows.To ease traffic, the authorities have ordered schools, banks, most private businesses and all government departments to remain shut. Borders to neighboring states will also be sealed, and over 100,000 police and security personnel are expected to patrol the streets.Among the tools at their disposal: heavy artillery, advanced AI-based cameras, jamming devices and sniffer dogs.\"There's a tremendous amount at stake for Modi with this G-20 summit,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.Ultimately, carrying out a successful summit could boost PM Modi's reputation as a competent administrator. It may also bolster BJP's chances in five looming state elections this year and the 2024 polls.\"New Delhi takes its presidency extremely seriously, and it has linked it not only to core national interests and foreign policy objectives, but also, even if indirectly, to domestic politics,\" Kugelman said.The location for this year's G-20 summit is as grand as they come. The world leaders will meet in a refurbished convention and exhibition center that's larger than Australia's Sydney Opera House and was designed by the international firm Aedas, which created Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. The entire renovation took four and a half years at a cost of Rs 2,700 crore.Reminders of the summit are everywhere in Delhi. Posters depicting PM Modi and the G-20 logo line the roads. Sculptures, fountains and flowers decorate roundabouts, and officials have strung lights on trees to illuminate them at night. Flyovers and railway bridges have gotten similarly colorful makeovers, with murals depicting Hindu gods and different dance and crafts traditions.The Indian authorities are also attempting to push less vaunted wildlife out of view. To scare away thousands of small monkeys that hang out near government offices and steal food from pedestrians, officials have dotted the sidewalks with life-sized cut-outs of the larger, black-faced langur species.The G-20 summit is one of the highest-profile international events New Delhi has hosted in years. It's also an opportunity to push past governance missteps further from memory, including one from 2010, when the capital hosted the Commonwealth Games. Among several issues, officials were accused of corruption in how they chose firms to provide sporting equipment and of using child labor to build facilities.Ahead of the G-20, the authorities seem to have considered every conceivable safety risk, sketching out rules for the most obscure of details. Until Sept. 12, hot air balloons are banned from sailing above the city, one order from the Delhi police reads. Another prohibits paragliding.India's security apparatus is robust: To protect visiting leaders, the armed forces will deploy commandos, snipers, bomb disposal squads, explosive detection teams, anti-drone technology, a \"quick reaction\" crew for chemical and nuclear threats, long range surveillance aircraft, and fighter jets, according to people familiar with the plans.\"To contain protests and gatherings, multiple domestic agencies are giving us real time information,\" Dependra Pathak, Delhi's special police commissioner for law and order, said in an interview.By Friday, access to New Delhi will be particularly difficult. Though the city's metro will continue to run, traffic police will prohibit most other travel near parliament and government ministries. The restrictions will effectively seal off the area, where elite G-20 guests are mostly populating five-star hotels.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comAhead of the summit, PM Modi apologized to Delhi's residents for the inconvenience of so many restrictions. But for many Indians, the G-20 summit, though abstract in its goals, is more exciting evidence that the country is an unmissable shaper of world affairs.\"The hosting of the G-20 summit is a responsibility of the entire country,\" PM Modi said in a speech late last month. \"We need to show the world that Delhi can handle this responsibility without any glitches.\"",

I am positive that we have matched our pledge with actions and outcomes,\" PM Modi said in an article which appeared in several newspapers today.He noted that the Voice of Global South Summit, which witnessed participation from 125 countries, was one of the foremost initiatives under India's presidency. He said, \"Our presidency has not only seen the largest-ever participation from African countries but has also pushed for the inclusion of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20.\" In the write-up, the Prime Minister said an interconnected world means interlinked challenges and noted great concern among many countries that the progress on SDGs (sustainable development goals) is off-track.The G20 2023 action plan on accelerating progress on SDGs will spearhead the future direction of the G20 towards implementing them, he said.In India, living in harmony with nature has been a norm since ancient times and it has been contributing its share towards climate action even in modern times, he said.PM Modi, however, noted that many countries of the Global South are at various stages of development and asserted that climate action must be a complementary pursuit. \"Ambitions for climate action must be matched with actions on climate finance and transfer of technology,\" he said.He added, \"We believe there is a need to move away from a purely restrictive attitude of what should not be done, to a more constructive attitude focusing on what can be done to fight climate change.\" In 2015, he said, the International Solar Alliance was launched and now, through the Global Biofuels Alliance, an India-led initiative, the world will be helped in energy transitions in tune with the benefits of a circular economy.He said democratising climate action is the best way to impart momentum to the movement. Just as individuals make daily decisions based on their long-term health, they can make lifestyle decisions based on the impact on the planet's long-term health, he said.\"Just like Yoga became a global mass movement for wellness, we have also nudged the world with Lifestyles for Sustainable Environment (LiFE),\" he added.\"Due to the impact of climate change, ensuring food and nutritional security will be crucial. Millets, or Shree Anna, can help with this while also boosting climate-smart agriculture. In the International Year of Millets, we have taken millets to global palates,\" PM Modi said.Noting that technology is transformative, he said it also needs to be made inclusive. \"In the past, the benefits of technological advancements have not benefited all sections of society equally. India, over the last few years, has shown how technology can be leveraged to narrow inequalities, rather than widen them,\" he added.That India is the fastest-growing large economy is no accident as its simple, scalable and sustainable solutions have empowered the vulnerable and the marginalised to lead its development story, he said.From space to sports, economy to entrepreneurship, Indian women have taken the lead in various sector, he said.He said, \"They have shifted the narrative from the development of women to women-led development. Our G20 Presidency is working on bridging the gender digital divide, reducing labour force participation gaps and enabling a larger role for women in leadership and decision-making.\" PM Modi said the G20 presidency is not merely a high-level diplomatic endeavour for India. \"As the Mother of Democracy and a model of diversity, we opened the doors of this experience to the world,\" he said.Today, accomplishing things at scale is a quality that is associated with India, and the G20 presidency is no exception, he said.\"It has become a people-driven movement. Over 200 meetings will have been organised in 60 Indian cities across the length and breadth of our nation, hosting nearly 100,000 delegates from 125 countries by the end of our term.

Another issue that is likely to figure prominently in the conversation is the Russia-Ukraine war.At a White House press briefing, John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said Joe Biden will leave for New Delhi on Thursday and meet PM Modi on Friday.Asked about what will be discussed at the bilateral meeting, Mr Kirby said, \"Well, without getting too far ahead of the meeting that hasn't happened, it's certainly going to be an appropriate follow-on to their very robust bilateral discussions here when we hosted Prime Minister Modi at the White House not long ago for a very complete and official visit.\"\"I think you can expect that they will discuss the agenda for the G20, particularly the economic cooperation and multilateral investment opportunities that stand before the G20, and the President's strong desire to see multilateral development bank reform and reshaping continue,\" news agency ANI quoted him as saying.Mr Kirby said he had little doubt that the two leaders will also talk about the shared challenge of climate change and how much the US is hoping to have a robust discussion at the G20 about a transition to clean energy technology.Another issue the NSC Coordinator said he had little doubt would be discussed is the ongoing war in Ukraine and the deleterious effect that it is having on low- and middle-income countries.\"In general, security, economic, and diplomatic challenges throughout the Indo-Pacific will certainly be something that they discuss,\" he added.While Indian officials are yet to confirm the date of the bilateral meeting, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also said that it will happen on Friday.At a separate White House briefing, Mr Sullivan said, \"On Friday, President Biden will participate in a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Modi of the Republic of India. And on Saturday and Sunday, the President will participate in the official sessions of the G20 Summit.\"The NSA said the United States' commitment to the G20 hasn't wavered and they hope this G20 Summit will show that the world's major economies can work together even in challenging times.\"So, as we head into New Delhi, our focus is going to be on delivering for developing countries; making progress on key priorities for the American people, from climate to technology; and showing our commitment to the G20 as a forum that can actually, as I said before, deliver. And thanks to the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and India's presidency, we hope we'll be able to do all of those things,\" he said.The NSA said one of the main focuses for the US heading into the G20 will be delivering on an agenda of fundamentally reshaping and scaling up the multilateral development banks, especially the World Bank and the IMF.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"We know that these institutions are some of the most effective tools that we have for mobilising transparent, high-quality investment into developing countries.

It is our century. For this, it is necessary to build a rule-based post-COVID world order and efforts by all for human welfare,\" the Prime Minister, co-chairing the summit, said.\"The progress of free and open Indo-Pacific and elevating the voice of the Global South is in the common interest of all,\" he said.The Prime Minister also reaffirmed that ASEAN is the central pillar of India's Act East Policy and it fully supports ASEAN centrality and its outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\"Our history and geography connect India and ASEAN. Along with shared values, regional unity, peace, prosperity, and a shared belief in a multipolar world also binds us together,\" he said, adding the grouping holds a \"prominent place\" in India's Indo-Pacific initiative.It was the first summit between the two sides since the elevation of their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership last year.\"Today, even in an environment of global uncertainties, there is continuous progress in every field in our mutual cooperation.This is a testament to the strength and resilience of our relationship.\" In his opening remarks, PM Modi said: \"ASEAN matters because here everyone's voice is heard, and ASEAN is the epicentre of growth because the ASEAN region plays a crucial role in global development.\"\"'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' -- 'one earth, one family, one future', this sentiment is also the theme of India's G-20 Presidency,\" PM Modi noted.ASEAN-India dialogue relations started with the establishment of a sectoral partnership in 1992.This graduated to a full dialogue partnership in December 1995 and a summit-level partnership in 2002.The ties were elevated to a strategic partnership in 2012.The 10 member countries of ASEAN are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe ties between India and ASEAN have been on a significant upswing in the last few years with the focus being on boosting cooperation in the areas of trade and investment as well as security and defence.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

It would be unsafe to rely on his testimony to convict the accused for the offence of murder, it noted.\"No doubt, different people react differently to a given situation. But if it had truly been an issue between few individuals fighting on the street, natural course of human conduct would be to collect people to solve out issues,\" the bench said.\"However, where villagers in general, and none in specific, assault a person accused of his involvement with a lady, it is quite natural for bystanders not to intervene,\" it said.The bench said the prosecution has not been able to convincingly prove the genesis of the crime and the manner in which the murder took place and by whom.The bench observed that evidence led by the prosecution gives rise to a strong probability of the killing being a consequence of mob action on the deceased for his alleged involvement with the woman.\"The judgment and order of the high court as well as of the trial court are set-aside. The appellants are acquitted of the charge for which they have been tried,\" it said, while allowing the appeals.The top court noted the appellants are reported to have been released on bail during the pendency of appeal and they need not surrender.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"In case they are not on bail, they shall be released forthwith unless wanted in any other case,\" it said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Washington:For two and a half decades, it has been a top and consistent goal for the United States across very different presidencies -- encouraging the rise of India. As New Delhi takes the global stage by leading the Group of 20 summit, President Joe Biden will be there as a cheerleader, even as US policymakers come to accept that India's interests will at times be at odds with Washington's.The gathering comes the same year that India topped China as the most populous nation and surpassed its former colonizer Britain as the fifth-largest economy, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi being feted on visits to Washington, Paris and elsewhere.\"I think in some ways, Prime Minister Modi has wanted to make it India's coming-out party to the world -- as a major power, with its own independent voice, whose time has come,\" Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said of this weekend's G20 summit.The United States has viewed the fellow democracy as a natural ally that can rival an autocratic and increasingly assertive China, which has clashed with India on their disputed border.But India has stood firm against another US priority by refusing to isolate Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, a nod to its historic ties with Moscow. Heading into the G20, India has sought to play down geopolitics and seek consensus on development issues such as debt relief and climate change.Bridge between West and SouthAlyssa Ayres, who helped build relations with New Delhi as a State Department official, said it should come as no surprise that India, a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, remains \"fiercely independent.\"She said that India saw no contradiction as it seeks \"ties with all across the board.\"\"It's a mark of how India sees its leadership role that it has explicitly focused its G20 presidency on bridging concerns of the world's largest economies with those of the Global South,\" said Ayres, now dean of George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs.The Biden administration has repeatedly saluted PM Modi's leadership and said it will work with India to achieve success at the G20, including on reforming international economic institutions.Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, has said the United States also wants to show that the G20 can deliver -- boosting the role of the US-backed group representing some 85 percent of global GDP at a time that the BRICS club of emerging economies, which includes India but has been championed largely by China, is expanding.Aparna Pande, a South Asia expert at the Hudson Institute, said that India, in its quest to boost its own global role, has always favored a multipolar world rather than one dominated by a single power.Despite its differences with the United States, India still offers a strong partner at a time that China is wooing developing countries, she said.\"India's strong ties to the Global South -- the former developing and non-aligned world -- make India the ideal bridge for the US and its allies,\" she said.Agreeing to disagree on RussiaChinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are both skipping the G20, an absence Biden is sure to use to his advantage.Xi may have faced a frosty, sidelined reception in New Delhi. While India has not joined sanctions on Russia, Putin's presence would have proven a major distraction as he is shunned by the West and faces an international arrest warrant.When Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States was \"very concerned\" about India's position but has \"grudgingly accepted it,\" said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the nonpartisan Wilson Center think tank.\"I think that Washington may even see India's position as one that could have advantages for the US if there is a desire down the road to try to push for some type of mediated, negotiated end to the war,\" Kugelman said.Kugelman added he believed the Biden administration was \"quietly concerned\" about domestic developments inside India but has decided it is best to \"stay quiet.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe administration has decided that \"if the US were to start flagging the rights and democracy issue, that would risk imperiling a relationship that is much too important for the US to lose,\" he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

It becomes theBrahmaputrain Assam and the Jamuna in Bangladesh before it empties into the Bay of Bengal.To counter what some experts have called a \"ticking water bomb for residents downstream (in Arunachal and Assam)\", the centre plans to build a large barrage - a low-lying structure with gates to control the flow of water - across the Siang, Mr Khandu said as he sought support for the idea.\"The Indian government has raised objections over repercussions to Siang as a result of China's project. If this (the Chinese dam) happens, what will be the condition of the Siang? The river may shrink because water is diverted... we may be able to cross it on foot. There is also threat of floods if excess water is released... there will be massive floods in Siang belt, Assam and even Bangladesh.\"\"In case of excess water, we need to have big structures to protect ourselves from floods... the centre too has expressed concern and plans to build a barrage so we can keep Siang alive,\" the Chief Minister said during a Zero Hour discussion initiated by Congress MLA Lombo Tayeng.Mr Khandu noted that some members of the public in the Siang Valley were blocking the government's initial geographical survey work and said he plans to personally visit the area to \"request villagers cooperate and allow survey and investigation work for proposed barrage\".\"If there is diversion of water, there will be floods and land erosion of lakhs of hectares of cultivated land. Once survey is completed then centre can give us clear picture of the matter,\" he said.Underlining the serious nature of the problem at hand, Mr Khandu called on the public and Arunachal Pradesh lawmakers to think of the state and country's long-term future.China's Tibet Mega Dam Plan Raises ConcernChina's dam is expected to produce triple the electricity produced by the Three Gorges - the world's largest power station - and this has environmentalists in India and abroad deeply worried.It is mentioned in China's strategic 14th Five-Year Plan, unveiled in March 2021.The structure will span the river before it leaves the Himalayas and flows into India, straddling the world's longest and deepest canyon at an altitude of more than 1,500 metres (4,900 feet).The river is also home to two other projects and six others are in the works or under construction.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comREAD |China To Build Major Dam On Brahmaputra That Could Impact India: ReportThe Three Gorges created a reservoir and displaced 1.4 million inhabitants upstream and a senior official at the Stimson Center, a think tank based in the United States has said \"building a dam (like this) is likely a really bad idea for many reasons\", including fears of big earthquakes and landslides.",

        "text": "Mr Ramesh had claimed the agenda of every special session in the past was known in advance.New Delhi:Union minister Pralhad Joshi on Thursday accused senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh of twisting facts about constitutional provisions and procedures related to parliament sessions.It is crucial to stop the spread of misinformation that scandalises parliament and its procedures, the parliamentary affairs minister said in a rejoinder to Mr Ramesh who had accused him of being \"misleading\" in his reply to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's letter to the Prime Minister.The Congress has been targeting the government for not disclosing the agenda of the five-day special session starting from September 18.Mr Ramesh had claimed the agenda of every special session in the past was known in advance and alleged that it was only the Modi government that \"distorts\" parliamentary conventions.Seeking to set the record straight, Mr Joshi accused him of \"falsely claiming\" that the historic function in Parliament's Central Hall on June 30, 2017, for the GST rollout, was a Parliament session.\"That's just not true! It wasn't a session under Article 85 of the Constitution,\" he said on X.\"Now, let's address another misrepresentation. Mr Ramesh mentioned a \"Special Sitting in Central Hall on 26 November, 2019\" for the Constitution's 70th anniversary. But, once again, it wasn't a parliamentary session under Article 85 of the Constitution,\" Mr Joshi said.

Jairam Ramesh's https://t.co/cmFCcL6Iwo Pralhad Joshi (@JoshiPralhad)September 7, 2023A session of Parliament under Article 85 of the Constitution is precisely that, and the agenda will be shared in accordance with established parliamentary practices, he said.The Article 85 deals with sessions and states that the \"President will from time to time summon each House of Parliament to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit, but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session.\"Mr Joshi said it is important to differentiate between celebratory functions and formal parliamentary sessions. Accurate information matters in maintaining the integrity of our democratic processes, he added.In a jibe at Mr Ramesh, who is a Rajya Sabha MP and Congress general secretary, Mr Joshi used a quote that \"a compulsive contrarian may be a master of doubt, but they often miss the beauty of certainty founded in truth\".He said, \"Jairam Ramesh's recent statements have been quite misleading. He's twisting facts about constitutional provisions and parliamentary procedures.\"The summoning of Parliament, the minister said, is the greatest boon in a democracy. However, there is a lobby of compulsive contrarians who oppose the same, he added in a swipe at opposition parties. He asked Mr Ramesh to focus on accurate information and not let misleading statements cloud people's understanding of constitutional provisions and parliamentary procedures.Mr Joshi then raked up the Emergency proclaimed by then prime minister Indira Gandhi and said it was a Congress government which was known for subversion and distortion of parliamentary democracy.People of the world's largest democracy have seen the imposition of Emergency and how the rights of the people of this country and institutions were curbed by his party's government in 1975, he told Mr Ramesh.\"Your government's strike rate is spectacular in dismissing democratically elected state governments more than 90 times misusing Art 356,\" he added.Mr Ramesh's attack on Mr Joshi had come after the latter had accused Sonia Gandhi of trying to politicise the functioning of Parliament and create unnecessary controversy, in response to her letter to Prime Minister Modi.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMrs Gandhi wrote to PM Modi to point out, among other issues, that no agenda was listed for the upcoming special session of Parliament.

Disputes started between the parties from 2006.\"The appellant-wife registered a complaint under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The respondent-husband had questioned the character of the appellant-wife,\" the bench noted.The bench noted the husband claimed it was his wife who had left the matrimonial home and also demanded a medical examination of the wife, alleging she was living in adultery and had given birth to a child during the period of non-cohabitation.The request was rejected by the high court, the bench said, adding the couple has been living separately for a decade and half.\"As fairly stated at the Bar, the marriage does not survive any longer, and the relationship was terminated otherwise except by a formal decree of divorce. The status quo continues, awaiting an approval from this Court,\" the bench said, adding the facts would certainly make out a case for divorce.It said the trial court and the high court adopted a \"hyper-technical and pedantic approach\" in declining the decree of divorce.\"It is not as if the respondent-husband is willing to live with the appellant-wife. The allegations made by him against her are as serious as the allegations made by her against him. Both the parties have moved away and settled in their respective lives. There is no need to continue the agony of a mere status without them living together,\" the bench said, and granted the decree of divorce to the wife while setting set aside the order of the trial court and the Chhattisgarh High Court.It said courts must adopt an empathetic and contextual construction of the facts to avert the possibility of perpetuating trauma- mental and sometimes even physical- on the vulnerable party.\"It is needless to say that the courts will be guided by the principles of equity and may consider balancing the rights of the parties. The court, while applying these provisions, must adopt 'social-context thinking', cognisant of the social and economic realities, as well as the status and background of the parties,\" Justice Sundresh, who wrote the verdict on behalf of the bench, said.The top court said courts must also keep in mind that the home which is meant to be a happy and loveable place to live, becomes a source of misery and agony where the partners fight.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"When there are children they become direct victims of the said fights, though they may practically have no role in the breakdown of marriage.

        "title": "Global Regulatory Framework For Crypto Under India's G20 Presidency A Huge Milestone",
        "text": "Centre was looking to introduce Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021New Delhi:The G20 Summit this weekend will discuss the template and various building blocks for coordinated action on dealing with crypto assets, potentially paving the way for a global regulatory framework.A synthesis paper prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Financial Stability Board (FSB) at the behest of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors on overall crypto asset regulation will be taken up by the leaders.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had at the recent B20 Summit made a strong pitch for a global regulatory framework for crypto assets that would address the concerns of all stakeholders. Usage of crypto assets poses great challenges worldwide. There is an urgent need for crypto regulation to prevent its unethical use and at the same time to keep control over sovereign currencies.The Prime Minister's remarks suggest India's shift towards regulation rather than absolute ban. This change in stance is keeping up with the practical objective to accommodate cryptocurrencies within a regulatory framework while curbing unethical practices.In the Budget for financial year 2023, the Modi government had introduced a 30 per cent tax on gains made from virtual digital assets while clarifying that this wasn't a legal validity on cryptocurrencies.The government was looking to introduce the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, in the Lok Sabha last year, but the move was shelved following the central bank's reservations.The RBI (Reserve Bank of India) has been advocating for a complete ban on cryptocurrencies in India, though it has also launched the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Experts say that the CBDC may not fit the traditional definition of a cryptocurrency due to its centralised nature. Real cryptocurrencies are characterised by anonymity, decentralisation, and an absence of asset backing, features that CBDCs may not own.The IMF-FSB synthesis paper has a roadmap to support a coordinated and comprehensive policy and regulatory framework. Risks posed to emerging markets and developing economies will be considered. It will also address the ongoing global implementation of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards to combat money laundering and terrorism financing risks.Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography to secure their transactions and control the creation of new units. These are often bought with traditional currency like US dollars, euros or rupees. Bitcoin is the oldest and still the most relevant cryptocurrency in the world.Cryptocurrency fraud and scams have become quite common as the popularity of cryptocurrencies grows. Crypto markets and coin prices are extremely volatile in nature. There is no way to ascertain how cryptocurrencies are expected to behave in the future.\"Cryptocurrency as we all know, is a digital currency or a virtual accounting system. Unlike any national currency, it is not backed by any asset, tangible or intangible. No government or any bank upholds it. Any such transaction between parties done without the intermediation of banks or governments, stands to be volatile and unsafe. The developments in the field of international regulation are yet to catch up with the progress made by private players or operators who are the mastermind behind such illegal transactions,\" says Vandana Jain, a financial consultant.As per an IMF report, Japan and Switzerland have amended or introduced new legislation covering crypto assets and their service providers, while others (including the European Union, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States) are at the drafting stage. But national authorities have, on the whole, taken very different approaches to regulatory policy for crypto assets.Globally, however, there are no uniform regulatory bodies to monitor crypto. Hence, the framing of the global regulatory framework for crypto assets under India's G20 presidency is a huge milestone.Once the widely circulated cryptocurrency is incorporated into the regulatory system, then terrorist organisations and other unlawful groups may find that the digital world is not open. Last year in October, India hosted the 3rd Ministerial Conference on Countering Financing of Terrorism themed 'No Money for Terror' in Delhi. Experts and law enforcing agencies from 87 countries and 26 multilateral organisations opined that low-cost terror attacks are easy to mount and showed how jihadist groups could transfer money easily without using the international banking system.The purpose of the conference was to convey India's determination in its fight against terrorism. Canada highlighted the massive increase - to the extent of 2,000 per cent in the past few years in the use of virtual assets for terror.Terror financing in itself and as an instigator to crimes like money laundering, challenges national, regional and global security and threatens a nation's financial integrity. The counter-terror financing authorities in India continue to monitor organised digitised channels namely credit/debit cards and money value transfer services (MTSS), cash and hawala channels have sustained and are still primarily used by terror entities.Due to rapid digitisation in the country, the risk of misuse of fintech services is real. Gauging the growth of virtual asset terror elsewhere, cryptos are very much part of the problem in India.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier said that the G20 economies were exploring whether the group could collectively regulate cryptocurrencies. India has always maintained that given the sophisticated technologies involved with these crypto virtual assets, countries must come together and discuss if there can be some standard operating procedure to be followed by everyone to make a regulatory framework that can be effective.It's therefore a critical imperative that countries come together to build a common digital infrastructure to monitor such transactions and weed out the nefarious ones to safeguard the interests of their citizens from the vagaries of the dark web. India in its G20 presidency year has made it happen.",

The words and actions of a politician have an impact on his followers, party men and the public at large. It was imperative that this power was not to be misused for illegal and personal gains.\"The power-wielding politicians have an inherent responsibility in having a positive and healthy impact on the lives of the people and guiding them in the right path, but instead what we are witnessing today in many instances is that the politicians are using their political connections and power to threaten and create nuisance to the public at large. This court cannot sit back and watch that the common man is facing ordeals\", the judge added.The judge said this court was witnessing large scale exploitation of political power by certain politicians especially in land grabbing matters. This will pave the way for an unhealthy democracy.Using political power and influence to grab land from a powerless common man was nothing short of day-light robbery.

But every citizen of our Great Nation and his rights were Constitutionally protected.The Courts will not remain spectators, especially, when his/her right to carry on with a peaceful life under Article 21 was threatened, the judge added.The judge said political power should be used only for the benefit of the public and not to their detriment.When politicians were given such power by the common public, it must be used for socially beneficial issues and not for creating problems for self gains, the judge added.Earlier, when the case came up for hearing, the Deputy Commissioner of Police [Administration], Greater Chennai Police filed a status report stating that the order passed by the Court on this contempt petition, dated September 1, 2023 has been complied with.The tenant has already been evicted and the vacant possession was handed to the landlady by the Police authorities. The counsel for the petitioner also acknowledged the same.After it was brought to the notice of the court by the counsel for the petitioner that the arrears of rent for more than 5 years was yet to be settled by Ramalingam, the judge made the above observations.The judge further said in the case of the present contempt petition, it took 12 years for the elderly woman to vacate the tenant through the Court of Law with the assistance of Police. Rent has not been paid for many years. The husband of the contempt petitioner was aged about 75 years.

Rules framed under the Senior Citizen Act enumerates the duties and responsibilities of the District Collector to protect the life, security and dignity of the senior citizen, the judge added.The judge said the lengthy Court proceedings in Rent Control matters were being abused by certain litigants by protracting the case in order to evade eviction by the landlords and to recover arrears of rent.Even under the new enactment on Rental Law, few tenants were attempting to protract the legal proceedings with the gainful guidance of the legal brains and by taking undue advantage of the frequent adjournments being granted liberally by the Rent Controller /Courts.Such attempts were to be thwarted.

The ostensible reason given to support the impugned condition that an unmarried woman after marriage would migrate to her matrimonial house does not pass the test of reasonableness and prudence and thus, the mere fact that a candidate is unmarried cannot be a reason to disqualify her, the court said in its order.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com Depriving a woman of public employment on the grounds of her being unmarried, apart from being violative of fundamental rights guaranteed to a woman under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, impinges upon a woman's dignity, it stated.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

(File)New Delhi:India will be an important country in terms of manufacturing in future, Young Liu, Chairman and CEO of Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) has said, his latest comment adding to a growing chorus of global voices acknowledging the country's bold moves to position itself as electronics and hi-tech production powerhouse.In an interaction with reporters in Taipei, the top official of the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant said the development of the entire ecosystem and industrial chain, and opportunities for development in India are \"very, very huge opportunities\".\"If there is no big change, India will be a very important country in terms of manufacturing in the future,\" Mr Liu said.In the past, it took 30 years to build the entire supply chain ecosystem in China, he noted, adding that while it will take an \"appropriate amount of time in India\" and the process will be shorter given the experience. The environment too is not quite the same, he said pointing to the advent of new technologies like AI and generative AI.In July this year, while addressing SemiconIndia 2023, Foxconn had said it is optimistic about the direction of India's semiconductor roadmap and asserted that Taiwan is and will be India's most trusted and reliable partner.\"Let's do this together,\" the top boss of Foxconn had said at that time.Government sources noted that the Foxconn chief is backing PM's Make-in-India.Mr Liu has expressed that reforms and policies in India have created huge opportunities for the development of the entire electronics manufacturing ecosystem, the sources said citing the recent media briefing in Taipei where Liu spoke to reporters.It is pertinent to mention that India is wooing global IT and electronics players with policy sweeteners and incentive schemes, making a push to position itself as a global hub for hi-tech manufacturing.India hopes to play on the strength of its storied talent and skill base, vibrant market, and enabling policies to corner a substantial chunk of new investments flowing into electronics and semiconductor production, and global value chains.Recently, as many as 40 companies, including big names like Foxconn Group, HP, Dell and Lenovo, applied for incentives under India's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) IT hardware scheme for manufacturing laptops, PCs and servers.Last month, Foxconn also said it sees the potential of investing several billions of dollars in India if it gets to completely implement its plan.Mr Liu during Foxconn's second quarter earnings call in August had said that the company's Indian arm has achieved a turnover of close to USD 10 billion on an annual basis and there is a lot of investment potential in India.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comHe had said Foxconn operates about nine campuses in India.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Here's are the latest trends:The seven seats -- Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, Ghosi in Uttar Pradesh, Puthuppally in Kerala, Dhupguri in West Bengal, Dumri in Jharkhand, and Boxanagar and Dhanpur in Tripura -- went to poll on September 5.The by-election saw the INDIA alliance putting up a united front in the Ghosi constituency in Uttar Pradesh, where the voting was moderate at around 50.77 per cent, and in Jharkhand's Dumri where a total of 64.84 per cent of 2.98 lakh voters exercised their franchise.Out of the seven seats, three (Dhanpur, Bageshwar and Dhupguri) were held by the BJP and one each by the SP (Ghosi), CPI(M) (Boxanagar), JMM (Dumri) and the Congress (Puthuppally).In Uttar Pradesh, the Ghosi seat fell vacant after the resignation of Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA and OBC leader Dara Singh Chauhan, who rejoined the BJP.For the Bageshwar assembly bypoll in Uttarakhand, the counting will be done at 14 tables with 130 polling personnel on the job, District Magistrate Anuradha Pal said on Thursday.The Bageshwar seat fell vacant after the death of its MLA and cabinet minister Chandan Ram Das in April this year. He had won the seat four times since 2007.In Jharkhand, INDIA bloc and NDA candidates are keeping their fingers crossed ahead of the counting to Dumri assembly bypolls. The counting centre has been set up at Krishi Bazar Samiti, Pachambha, in Giridih district, an election official said.\"In all, 24 rounds of counting will be held and over 70 officials have been deployed for the exercise,\" Giridih Deputy Commissioner-cum-Election Officer Naman Priesh Lakra told PTI.\"Central Armed Police Force and various wings of Jharkhand police have been deployed to ensure free and fair counting,\" he said.Around 65 per cent of 2.98 lakh voters had exercised their franchise.In Tripura, the ECI has taken necessary steps to conduct the counting in a transparent way, a senior poll official said on Thursday.Counting of votes to both the seats - Boxanagar and Dhanpur - will take place at Sonamura Girls' HS School. \"There is tight security at the counting centre,\" Sepahijala district magistrate Vishal Kumar told PTI.BJP's Tafajjal Hussain, who unsuccessfully contested the last assembly election from Boxanagar, is contesting against CPI(M) nominee Mizan Hussain from there.On Wednesday, the CPI(M) announced to boycott the counting alleging largescale rigging in the two constituencies during voting.In West Bengal's Dhupguri, personnel of the central armed police forces and state police are guarding the strong room on the second campus of North Bengal University in Jalpaiguri, an official said.Around 76 per cent of 2.6 lakh eligible voters exercised their franchise in the by-election.CPI(M)'s Ishwar Chandra Roy is contesting as the candidate of the Congress-Left alliance, while the ruling TMC has fielded Nirmal Chandra Roy, a teacher by profession.The BJP has nominated Tapasi Roy, the widow of a CRPF jawan who died fighting terrorists in Kashmir a few years back.The bypoll to the seat was necessitated due to the death of sitting BJP MLA Bishu Pada Ray earlier this year.Dhupguri, a scheduled caste-reserved seat, has nearly 50 per cent Rajbanshi people and 15 per cent minority population.Kerala is also anxiously waiting for the result of the Puthuppally bypoll which saw an intense battle between the UDF and LDF to fill the seat left vacant by the demise of Congress stalwart Oommen Chandy.The constituency, located in the southern Kottayam district, witnessed a war of words for the past few weeks as the September 5 by-election was a prestigious battle for both the ruling and opposition fronts in the state.According to Election Commission sources, the counting of votes would begin by 8.00 am at the special counting station in the Baselius College. Postal and service ballots would be counted first, they said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe total number of booths in Puthuppally was 182, and the counting of votes in the electronic voting machines would be conducted in 13 rounds.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The charges carry a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail for Peter Navarro.Washington:Former U.S. President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro was found guilty on Thursday of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House of Representatives committee that investigated the 2021 attack on the Capitol.A 12-member jury found Navarro guilty of two counts of contempt after he refused to testify or turn over documents to the Democratic-led House panel that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 riot by Trump supporters and broader attempts by Trump, a Republican, to reverse his 2020 election defeat.\"The defendant choose allegiance to former President Trump over compliance with the subpoena,\" federal prosecutor Elizabeth Aloi told the jurors during closing arguments on Thursday. \"That is contempt. That is a crime.\"The charges carry a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail.Navarro is a hawk on China policy who advised Trump on trade issues during his presidency and also served on the COVID-19 task force. Navarro became the second close associate of Trump to be convicted for spurning the committee after Steve Bannon was found guilty last year of contempt of Congress for similarly defying a subpoena and was sentenced to four months in prison. Bannon is now appealing the conviction.The verdict in Navarro's case in federal court in Washington came after a trial that featured just one day of testimony from three prosecution witnesses, former staff members of the select committee. The defense did not call any witnesses or present any evidence.Navarro said ahead of trial that he did not have to comply with the committee's demand because Trump invoked executive privilege, a legal doctrine that shields some executive branch records and communications from disclosure.But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Navarro could not use this as a defense, finding that the defendant had not put forward evidence that Trump formally invoked executive privilege in response to the subpoena. Defense lawyer Stanley Woodward was left to argue that Navarro's failure to comply may have been an accident or a mistake.The verdict represented a victory for the Justice Department and the now-defunct select committee, which moved aggressively to secure testimony from many of Trump's top advisers before being disbanded when Republicans took control of the House in January.Many of the committee's findings were mirrored in a federal criminal indictment obtained by Special Counsel Jack Smith accusing Trump of attempting to subvert the election results, one of four criminal cases he faces as he runs to regain the presidency in 2024.The panel sought to interview Navarro about a plan devised by him and other Trump allies, dubbed the \"Green Bay Sweep,\" to delay Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. The committee concluded its work last year without interviewing Navarro.Navarro had said publicly that he was protecting the presidency by not sharing information with Congress.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comTrump supporters stormed the Capitol on the day that Congress met to certify Biden's victory, attacking police and sending lawmakers and others fleeing for safety. Trump has made false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Will Continue To Fight To Make Universities Corruption, Violence-Free: Bengal Governor",
        "text": "\"I want universities in the state to be free of violence,\" Bengal Governor said.Kolkata:West Bengal Governor CV Ananda Bose on Thursday said he will continue his fight to make state universities free of corruption and violence.His comments come at a time when the state government and the Raj Bhavan are embroiled in a war of words over the appointments of interim vice-chancellors of some state universities by the governor who is also chancellor of all state varsities.The Trinamool Congress said Mr Bose is conducting himself as dictated by BJP and not performing the role of the governor as defined in the Constitution and urged him to shun the confrontationist approach and sit for discussions.Speaking about the Raj Bhavan's recent move to appoint interim VCs, Mr Bose in a video message said, \"I have appointed them as the apex court ruled against some of the appointments earlier made by the state government.\" Alleging interim VCs appointed by him were being harassed, he said, \"Five (interim) VCs had to resign. Why? They told me they were being threatened by goons, senior IAS officers were exerting pressure on them. This is what the (interim) VCs told me in confidence. That is why five of them resigned. I did not ask them to resign. They resigned out of fear.\" \"There were allegations of corruption, sexual harassment and political interference against some VCs who were earlier appointed,\" he claimed.About the claims by the state government that he was overstepping his limits by appointing interim vice-chancellors of state universities, Bose said, \"The Hon'ble Supreme Court has ordered you (higher education department) ... your action was held illegal. The VCs appointed had to resign. Who will then be the VC? In such a situation, I appointed interim VCs.\" After the initial appointment of interim VCs by him a few months ago, the state education department described the action as wrong.\"The high court observed my action was right,\" Guvorner Bose said.Elaborating on the allegations against some of the VCs, he said, \"There are charges of corruption against some, charges of harassment of female students by some others, while some others are involved in a political game. That is the reason I could not go by the choice of the state while appointing interim VCs.\" \"I want universities in the state to be free of violence, free of corruption and be the best in India,\" Mr Bose said.He vowed in the name of Rabindranath Tagore, Netaji Subhas Chandra and Swami Vivekananda to continue to fight for a \"corruption-free academia\".Referring to the recent death of an undergraduate student of Jadavpur University, he said, \"This was one of the saddest moment of campus cannibalism.\" \"An innocent boy, a 17-year-old youth, lost his life... in a great university like JU. I am taking a vow, I am swearing by the name of Netaji, Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda that we will fight this battle till the end. This death will come under the scope of investigation,\" he said.Mr Bose said Bengal's GenNext is the state's biggest asset.Quoting Tagore's 'Banglar Mati Banglar Jol' song, he said \"We want to do some good work for Bengal.\"I wish to see a Bengal whose talent pool of students and learned professors take our universities to the top rung, make our universities as the best in the country,\" he said.The governor said \"Let us fight against corruption. Let us fight for our children.\" His response came days after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's blistering attack against him during a Teachers' Day programme, where she accused him of interfering in the state's education system, and threatened to sit on a dharna outside Raj Bhavan if the governor continued to function in this manner.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, \"the statement by CV Ananda Bose testifies again that he is conducting himself as dictated by BJP, at the behest of BJP, to satisfy his BJP bosses.\" \"Issues which could have been sorted out and solved in a concerted manner between the state and Raj Bhavan, in the interest of higher education sector of West Bengal, in the interest of the student community, are being kept alive and unnecessary controversy created. We tell him there is still time to shun confrontationist approach and sit for talks with the government,\" Ghosh told reporters.Supporting Mr Bose, opposition BJP said the governor said the right thing and whatever he is doing is for the interest of the state.BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, \"The TMC has brought the educational scenario in the state to a sorry state by its tendency to politicise the higher educational sector, putting its own men everywhere. As having pointed out by him, the governor is trying to clean up the mess created by TMC in the interest of higher education sector, as he is concerned about the suffering of students. Instead of supporting him, TMC resorts to ugly attacks on hon'ble governor which we protest.\" Attacking Mr Bose over the appointments, Banerjee had on Tuesday alleged that the governor was appointing interim VCs according to his whims by ignoring the state-appointed search committee.Noting that VCs must be picked from the names suggested by the five-member search committee, she alleged that Mr Bose was appointing people at his will with no regard to the suggestions of the panel.She had promised a 'tit-for-tat' action and threatened to block funding to all state universities that followed the governor's directions.\"I will see how you give salaries to these vice-chancellors (appointed by Bose),\" she had said.In his capacity as chancellor of West Bengal's state universities, the governor had appointed eight interim VCs recently.In a recent interview to PTI, Bose had said the Calcutta HC has said that on appointments of VCs, the governor needs to consult the state government, but has upheld that he does not need the state's concurrence in appointing VCs.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comReferring to the student death in JU, he had said, our universities have become highly politicised. ... \"Universities are suffering from hooliganism which outsiders have imported into the campus,\" he had said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

In others, he delivers domestically bankable slogans about development, jobs and \"giving voice to the global south\".Sumedha Dasgupta, senior Asia analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit, believes that \"India will try to be a credible voice that can facilitate dialogue between the global north and south.\"India, fresh from celebrating the cementing of its position as a space power by landing a craft on the Moon in August, has portrayed its hosting of the G20 as a coming-of-age moment that makes it a key global player.On Thursday, PM Modi repeated his desire to expand the bloc into the \"G21\" with the \"inclusion of the African Union as a permanent member\".Tackling climate changePM Modi has tried to use the G20 to build consensus among key economies to reform global multilateral institutions like the United Nations to give a greater say to developing countries such as India, Brazil and South Africa.But with China represented by Premier Li Qiang rather than Xi, it is far from clear what, if anything, can be agreed.Representatives from 20 leading economies are gathering in the Indian capital at a time of intense trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, China and the United States.The grouping is also split over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with many developing members more concerned with high grain prices than joining diplomatic condemnations of Moscow's behaviour.PM Modi's efforts to urge G20 leaders to sidestep deep divisions to address critical global issues -- including global debt restructuring and commodity price shocks following Russia's invasion -- have been unsuccessful in ministerial meetings ahead of the summit.A G20 energy ministers' meeting in July failed to agree on a roadmap to phase down the use of fossil fuels -- or even mention coal, the dirty fuel that remains a key energy source for economies like India and China.Xi's absence will also impact Washington's bid to keep the G20 the main forum of global economic cooperation, and its efforts to make a financing push for developing countries.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Without China being on board... issues may not really see the light of day or reach any logical conclusion,\" said Happymon Jacob, a politics professor at India's Jawaharlal Nehru University.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

His resignation necessitated a by-election in the seat, whichhas been wonby the Samajwadi Party's Sudhakar Singh with a margin of 42,759 votes.Delivering a big blow to the ruling CPI(M), Chandy Oommen of the Congress-UDF alliance won the Puthuppally by-election in Kerala by a margin of over 36,000 votes.

(Representational)Kolkata/Lucknow/Kottayam:The results for bypolls to seven assembly seats in six states will be declared today in what is being seen as a major test for the opposition alliance INDIA against the BJP-led NDA ahead of the polls in five states later this year and Lok Sabha elections in 2024.The counting of votes began at 8 am at centres set up in the respective states.The seven seats -- Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, Ghosi in Uttar Pradesh, Puthuppally in Kerala, Dhupguri in West Bengal, Dumri in Jharkhand, and Boxanagar and Dhanpur in Tripura -- went to polls on September 5.The by-election saw the INDIA alliance putting up a united front in the Ghosi constituency in Uttar Pradesh where the polling percentage was 50.77 and in Jharkhand's Dumri where a total of 64.84 per cent of 2.98 lakh voters exercised their franchise.Out of the seven seats, three (Dhanpur, Bageshwar and Dhupguri) were held by the BJP and one each by the Samajwadi Party (Ghosi), CPI(M) (Boxanagar), JMM (Dumri) and the Congress (Puthuppally).In Uttar Pradesh, the Ghosi seat fell vacant after the resignation of SP MLA and OBC leader Dara Singh Chauhan, who rejoined the BJP.For the Bageshwar assembly bypoll in Uttarakhand, the counting will be done at 14 tables with 130 polling personnel on the job, District Magistrate Anuradha Pal said on Thursday.The Bageshwar seat fell vacant after the death of its MLA and cabinet minister Chandan Ram Das in April this year.

At the same time, he has also sounded caution on using foreign policy for domestic politics.Manmohan Singh, who was Prime Minister for two terms of the Congress-led UPA between 2004 and 2014, is among the leaders invited to a G20 dinner on Saturday, according to sources.Speaking toThe Indian Expresson India's G20 presidency, Dr Singh said foreign policy had become far more important to domestic politics than during his time. It was important to be restrained in using diplomacy for party politics, he said.\"I am very glad that India's rotational chance for the Presidency of the G20 came during my lifetime and I am witness to India hosting world leaders for the G20 summit. Foreign policy has always been an important element of India's governance framework, but it is fair to say that it has become even more relevant and important to domestic politics today than earlier. While India's standing in the world should rightfully be an issue in domestic politics, it is equally important to exercise restraint in using diplomacy and foreign policy for party or personal politics,\" said the 90-year-old former PM.Dr Singh weighed in on the government's handling of a tough diplomatic position on the Ukraine-Russia war, saying it had done \"the right thing\".\"When two or more powers are caught in a conflict, there is immense pressure on other nations to choose sides. I believe India has done the right thing in putting our sovereign and economic interests first while also appealing for peace. The G20 was never envisaged as the forum for settling security-related conflicts. It is important for the G20 to set aside security differences and keep its focus on policy coordination to tackle the challenges of climate, inequality and confidence in global trade,\" he said.On China ties and President Xi Jinping skipping the summit, he said he hoped Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take all steps necessary to protect India's territorial and sovereign integrity, but added that he would not like to offer advice to the government.\"It is not right for me to offer advice to the Prime Minister on how to handle complex diplomatic matters. It is unfortunate that the Chinese President Xi Jinping has chosen not to attend the G20 summit. I hope and believe the Prime Minister will take all steps necessary to protect India's territorial and sovereign integrity and defuse bilateral tensions,\" said the veteran Congress leader.Speaking on challenges ahead as India celebrates 75 years of Independence, Dr Singh said he was \"more optimistic than worried\", but sounded a note of caution.\"On the whole, I am more optimistic about India's future than worried. However, my optimism is contingent on India being a harmonious society, which is the bedrock for all progress and development. India's innate instinct is to welcome and celebrate diversity which must be preserved,\" said the two-time Prime Minister.Dr Singh also praised India's space agency ISRO for Chandrayaan's successful moon landing. Chandrayaan 1 was launched when he was Prime Minister.\"It is a matter of great pride that India's scientific establishment has once again proved its mettle as being among the best in the world. Our efforts over the last seven decades in promoting scientific temper in society and creating institutions have yielded enormous gains and made us all proud. I am really thrilled that the Chandrayaan mission, which was launched in 2008, has reached new heights by being the first to reach the south pole of the Moon. My heartfelt congratulations to all the women and men in ISRO,\" he said.On economic challenges and India's position, Dr Singh highlighted that the country's external trade soared during his tenure. This played a significant role in integrating India's economy with the global market.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"India's external trade as a share of its GDP doubled in the decade from 2005 to 2015, which benefitted us enormously, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty. This also means that India's economy is much more integrated with the global economy. During the 2008 financial crisis, the G20 did very well in coordinating policy responses, strengthening global financial safety nets and initiating a process of inter-governmental coordination. Currently, there is talk of de-globalisation and new types of trade restrictions. These can disrupt the existing order but also open new opportunities for India in global supply chains. It is in India's economic interests to not get trapped in conflicts and maintain an equilibrium of trading relationships across nations and regions,\" he advised.",

He lived among tribal neighbours and friends. He is fluent in the Kuki tribes' languages.His friend, Amarjit Maibam, 28, also from the Kuki-dominated district, has also lost everything.\"All Meitei houses at Khuga Tampak, about a thousand of them including ours, were set on fire, looted and destroyed by miscreants. Our village wears the look of a war devastated zone,\" Mr Maibam said.Mr Meisnam and Mr Maibam are among some 15,000 Meiteis whose houses in 11 villages in Churachandpur were destroyed in the unprecedented ethnic violence that began on May 3.They have taken shelter at relief camps in the valley districts. The two men are upset over the demolition of houses belonging to the Meiteis by miscreants after they fled from the violence in Churachandpur.Ronald Meisnam and Amarjit Maibam are among some 15,000 Meiteis whose houses in 11 villages in Churachandpur were destroyed in the unprecedented ethnic violence that began on May 3\"Our house and other Meitei homes have been flattened in a systematic way by using heavy machineries by miscreants as if they are the rightful owners of our plots,\" Mr Meisnam, in tears, said. He holds a BE (Electronics and Communications) degree from the Manipur Institute of Technology.\"The police in Churachandpur, who are well aware of these unlawful acts, have not taken any action against the culprits,\" he said.Chief Minister N Biren Singh, who had been informed about these illegal activities, has assured action against the perpetrators. But there has been no reports of arrest of the culprits to date, adding to the angst to the Meiteis who lost everything in Churachandpur.\"Unlike in Churachandpur, none of the Kuki houses and the properties that were destroyed in the valley districts during the clash, have not been bulldozed and flattened, and the structures are heavily guarded by the police and the security forces round-the-clock. We strongly feel there are two separate laws against - one in the valley against our equanimity and the other in the hills,\" Mr Meisnam said.The Churachandpur Superintendent of Police has filed a case over the demolition of Meitei properties by miscreants in the Kuki-dominated district, a state government officer said, asking for anonymity.Internally displaced people and victims of the ethnic conflict who have lost important documents or records likepattas(property papers) of landholdings, educational certificates, and financial records need not worry as these documents would be re-issued to them by district magistrates after verification wherever the displaced people are staying, the officer said.Manipur has not returned to full normalcy yet. Mr Meisnam and Mr Maibam - like other internally displaced Meiteis - however, desperately want to return home in Churachandpur to ensure their family land is not lost.\"Churachandpur is the only tribal district in the state where the largest number of Meiteis are living. We don't want to set a new history when all Meiteis leave the district and scatter in the valley areas or elsewhere,\" Mr Meisnam said.\"My father, who was born at the same Mandop Leikai house, was reluctant to leave even when miscreants started attacking us on May 3. He asked why should we run away from our birthplace? Only after our hard insistence did he agree to come with us. We left carrying whatever we could,\" Mr Meisnam said.He alleged insurgent groups have a strong grip on Churachandpur. Soon after the Kuki-Paite clash in 1997, the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) was formed to protect the Zo people. Then other Kuki insurgent groups popped up and they held on to specific areas of Churachandpur as their area of dominance, Mr Meisnam said.Due to the complete submission to Kuki insurgent groups, the Meiteis, who had strong socio-fabric bonding with all communities in the district, gradually began facing subtle hostilities in Churachandpur over a period of years, Mr Meisnam alleged.He said the Meiteis were also denied basic fundamental rights in Churachandpur.\"Many Meiteis had a hard time getting domicile certificates and evenpattaorjamabandifor their own land from the office concerned in Kuki-majority Churachandpur. Among the Meiteis, those who had connections with influential people got such documents, and others were left in the lurch,\" Mr Meisnam said.\"There was a time when Meiteis at Khumujmaba Leikai formed a group caled Khumujamba Pattadar Association, only to meet district officials to get their landpattas. But because of the hostile atmosphere, some Meiteis left their villages for valley districts,\" Mr Meisnam said.\"Our rich neighbours offered a huge amount to buy our land, but my father rejected it for the love of his birthplace. We have lost everything after the ethnic clash,\" the Churachandpur resident said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comMr Meisnam is among thousands of displaced Meiteis who have been demanding the government to take legal action against the miscreants who destroyed their houses.\"We are in the middle of nowhere at present. We request the government to give exemplary punishment to those perpetrators who bulldozed and flattened our houses. The government should take measures to ensure we can return home,\" Mr Meisnam said.",

The court should not accept the apology when it appears that saying sorry is nothing but a legal trick to wriggle out of responsibility. A true apology must be a deep ethical act of introspection, self-introspection, atonement and self-reform. In its absence, an apology can be termed as farce.\"The apology tendered should not be accepted as a matter of course and the court is not bound to accept the same. The apology may be unconditional, unqualified and bona fide, still if the conduct is serious, which has caused damage to the dignity of the institution, the same should not be accepted,\" the bench said.The top court said there ought not to be a tendency of courts to show compassion when disobedience of an undertaking or an order is with impunity and with total consciousness.It said the sanctity of judicial proceedings is paramount to a society governed by law.Otherwise, the very edifice of democracy breaks and anarchy reigns, it added.Dismissing the appeal filed by the contemnors, the bench granted two weeks' time to the appellants to surrender and serve out the sentence as imposed by the high court.It said the object of the discipline enforced by courts in case of contempt of court is not to vindicate the dignity of the court or the person of the judge, but to prevent undue interference with the administration of justice.\"Any interference with the course of justice is an affront to the majesty of law and the conduct of interference is punishable as contempt of court. Public interest demands that there should be no interference with the judicial process and the effect of the judicial decision should not be preempted or circumvented.\"If a party, who is fully in the know of the judgment or order of the court, is conscious and aware of the consequences and implications of the order of the court, acts in violation thereof, it must be held that disobedience is wilful,\" the bench said.To establish contempt of court, it is sufficient to prove that the conduct was wilful and that the contemnor knew all the facts that made it a breach of the undertaking, it added.\"The Act of 1971 is intended to correct a person deviating from the norm and trying to breach the law or assuming law on to himself. It intends to secure the confidence of the people in the administration of justice by disciplining those erring in disobeying the orders of the court or undertaking given to the court.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"We may take judicial notice of the fact with all humility at our command that over a period of time, the courts have shown undue leniency and magnanimity towards the contemnors.

We believe that it will be done in a democratic manner, but democracy does not eliminate familial ties that a person may have with a political party,\" said Ambassador Sarvajit Chakravarti, who has served two stints in Dhaka and is currently associated with a think tank Ceners-K.The G20 summit which will be held in New Delhi over the coming weekend will be attended by most of the top leaders of the world.This is possibly the first time Sheikh Hasina's daughter will be by her mother's side during an official visit to India, and analysts believe this to be significant in many ways.Ms Wazed, an autism expert who is standing for election as regional director for South-East Asia Region (SEARO) at World Health Organization (WHO), will be looking for India, one of 11 countries in the region, to endorse her.Bangladesh's top diplomats are believed to have lobbied for her election among ASEAN countries.India will have to choose between her and Nepal's Shambhu Prasad Acharya for the WHO job.Given the importance that India attaches to its ties with both Bangladesh and Nepal, the choice is likely to be a tough one.\"A visit by Sheikh Hasina's daughter to India at a global meeting is an interesting development. Besides her nomination for an international organisation, it bears watching if she will opt for a larger role in Bangladesh,\" said Shantanu Mukherjee IPS (Retd), former National Security Advisor to Mauritius and a Bangladesh expert.Added Prof Omprakash Mishra, an expert in international relations and former VC of North Bengal University, \"India has always been supportive of our increasingly impotant neighbour (Bangladesh) in multinational forums.\" Sheikh Hasina has yet to indicate any potential successor to the leadership of Awami League, though her son Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, or Joy Wazed as he is popularly known, was at one time seen by many as a potential candidate.Saima Wazed who has been an advisor to the WHO director general on Mental Health and Autism as well as a member of WHO expert advisory panel on Mental Health, has till now shown no inclination to enter politics.\"We have not seen Sheikh Hasina suggest any succession plan as yet though over the years we have noted that her son Sajeev being given responsibilities on IT etc by the Awami League. Now, Saima Wazed has also come into the picture. One can only presume that both are being groomed for a political role in the future,\" said Dr Sreeradha Datta, former director Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies and currently fellow with National University of Singapore.Bangladesh is headed for a general election in the coming winter months where the ruling Awami League will be looking to win for an unprecedented fourth time.However, the principal opposition party, BNP, led by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, which has earlier accused the Hasina government of vote rigging, has said it will boycott the elections unless Hasina steps down and allows a caretaker government to conduct the elections, a demand unlikely to be conceded by the Awami League-led government.While the US has some four months back announced a policy which reserves the right to deny visas to individuals including officials and politicians involved in hindering free and fair elections in the country, many other countries seem to be endorsing Hasina's leadership of a buoyant Bangladesh which is now being seen as a rising economic star in Asia.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comFrench President Emanuel Macron will be visiting Bangladesh right after the G20 summit in Delhi, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Dhaka ahead of the summit.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

These included interventions to create a more enabling legal and regulatory framework, national policies to expand account ownership, and leveraging Aadhaar for identity verification,\" the World Bank document noted.Since its launch in 2014, the first year under Narendra Modi's prime ministership, the number of PM Jan Dhan Yojana accounts tripled from 147.2 million in March 2015 to 462 million by June 2022; women own 56 percent of these accounts, more than 260 million.The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) -- the national mission for financial inclusion and banking the unbanked - has completed nine years of implementation. The initiative was announced by PM Modi in his maiden Independence Day address from Red Fort in 2014. Later, he launched the programme on August 28, 2014.PMJDY has brought the unbanked into the banking system, expanded the financial architecture of India and brought financial inclusion to almost every adult.Further, the World Bank also noted how India leveraged technology to directly transfer benefits to the citizens, besides using UPI for retail payments.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"The DPI in India has also enhanced efficiency for private organizations through reductions in the complexity, the cost and the time taken for business operations in India,\" it said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "No deadline has been set to complete the study (representational)India is studying possible responses to a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan following discreet inquiries from the US on how the country could contribute in the event of a war, according to senior government officials.About six weeks ago, Defense Chief General Anil Chauhan - the top military commander - commissioned a study to examine the wider impact of any war over the island that also involves the US and its allies, and what action India could take in response, according to two senior Indian officials, who asked not to be named since discussions are private. The order came after the US raised the issue in several different forums, they said.The study will assess various war scenarios and provide options for India in case a conflict breaks out, they said. Some military commanders believe that strong statements may suffice as a response in case the war is short, but ultimately that will not be enough if the conflict drags on like Russia's war in Ukraine, the officials said.India's preparation for a potential war over Taiwan shows how its policy of \"multi-alignment\" will be tested in the event of a drastic deterioration of US-China ties. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has forged its own path on international relations, effectively hedging its bets by developing close ties to the US while refusing to join international sanctions on Russia.Yet tensions with China have also flared along their disputed Himalayan border, contributing to a deterioration in relations that may have prompted President Xi Jinping to skip the Group of 20 summit this weekend in New Delhi. India has strengthened defense ties with the US in recent years, joining the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue along with Japan and Australia - a band of democracies intent on countering China's growing influence.One option the Indian military will study involves serving as a logistics hub to provide repair and maintenance facilities for allied warships and aircraft, as well as food, fuel and medical equipment for armies resisting China, the officials said. A more extreme scenario, they added, would assess the potential for India to get directly involved along their northern border, opening a new theater of war for China.While no deadline has been set to complete the study, the Indian military is under orders to finish it as soon as possible, one of the officials said. The options prepared will be available for PM Modi and other political leaders to make a final call on any action should the need arise, the official said.The Defence and Foreign ministries didn't respond to emailed questions. The US State Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\"By hyping up the Taiwan question, creating tensions and provoking confrontation, the US attempts to turn the Taiwan question into an international issue,\" Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, told reporters in Beijing on Friday. \"This is highly dangerous.\"India and China have mobilized thousands of troops, artillery guns, tanks and missiles closer to the unmarked border running some 3,500 km, roughly the length of the US-Mexico boundary. Diplomatic talks have yielded little, with China last month releasing a new map claiming India-controlled territory that Foreign Minister S Jaishankar described as \"absurd.\"India has publicly resisted efforts to make the Quad appear like a military alliance, and remains reliant on Russia - China's most important diplomatic partner - for weapons that would be used in any regional war. Even so, it has quietly sought better relations with Taiwan: Three former Indian military chiefs who stepped down in the past year all visited Taiwan last month.Five years ago, India and the US signed a Logistics-Exchange Memorandum of Agreement, a foundational pact to allow refueling and replenishing of warships and aircraft, as well as access to bases when required.Even though India is examining military options, it remains unlikely that the nation would get involved directly in a war over Taiwan, according to Lisa Curtis, senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Washington-based Centre for a New American Security, who earlier worked with the National Security Council, CIA and the State Department. It's possible India may provide access to places like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands near Southeast Asia, she added.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"If there were to be some kind of conflict or crises in the Taiwan Strait, I think India's position would be to stand back and not get militarily involved,\" she said. \"Even though they may support Taiwan with statements and humanitarian assistance, I think they would be very weary about providing any kind of military assistance to the United States.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "The UN Secretary-General urged countries to come together and act together for the common good.New Delhi:A day after an official said the United Nations Secretary-General has been a \"strong advocate\" for India getting a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, Antonio Guterres has said in New Delhi that the institution needs deep structural reform.Stating that the world is in a difficult moment of transition, Mr Guterres, who is in the country for the G20 Summit, called upon leaders of the prestigious economic grouping to show leadership in two key areas - climate and saving Sustainable Development Goals.In a press briefing ahead of the summit, the UN chief said, \"Let me begin by expressing my gratitude to India for the warm welcome, and my hope that India's presidency of the G20 will help lead to the kind of transformative change our world so desperately needs.\"Mr Guterres said India has been doing everything possible to fully represent the interests of the Global South in the preparation of the summit. \"I think it is fair to say that India has indeed corresponded to its promise not only to speak on behalf of the Global South but to put the development agenda in the centre of the G20 work,\" he said.'Phrase Inspired ByMaha Upanishad'On the theme for the G20 summit, the UN Secretary-General said, \"I welcome the focus on 'One Earth, One Family, One Future'. This phrase inspired by theMaha Upanishadfinds profound resonance in today's world: not just as a timeless ideal - but as an indictment of our times.\"Mr Guterres observed that if the world is indeed one global family, it is now resembling a rather dysfunctional one. \"Divisions are growing, tensions are flaring up, and trust is eroding, which together raise the spectre of fragmentation, and ultimately, confrontation. This fracturing would be deeply concerning in the best of times, but in our times, it spells catastrophe,\" he rued.Security Council ReformPointing out that the world is \"in a difficult moment of transition\", Mr Guterres said the future is multipolar, but multilateral institutions reflect a bygone age. \"The global financial architecture is outdated, dysfunctional, and unfair. It requires deep, structural reform. And the same can be said of the United Nations Security Council,\" he said.Responding to a question on whether he thinks India is a strong contender to become part of the UN Security Council, Mr Guterres said, \"It is not for me to decide who will be in the Security Council, it is for member states. It is obvious that India is today the country with the largest population and it is obvious that India is a very important partner in the world multilateral system. It is for me to say that I believe we need the reform of the Security Council to reflect the realities of today's world.\"The UN chief asserted that the world needs effective international institutions which are rooted in 21st-century realities and based on the UN Charter and international law.\"That is why I have been advocating for bold steps to make those global institutions truly universal and representative of today's realities, and more responsive to the needs of developing economies,\" he said.Speaking on the sidelines of the ASEAN-India Summit and East Asia Summit in Jakarta on Thursday, Mr Guterres' spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, had said that the UN chief has been a \"strong advocate\" for India getting a permanent seat at the council.In an exclusive interview with NDTV last month, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had also pushed for UNSC reforms. \"At some stage, the members themselves have to wake up to the realisation that the longer they put off reforms, the less representative the security council is, frankly the less the credibility of the UN would be. People will then go and do things outside the UN,\" he had said.'Challenges Galore'The UN Secretary-General said the world has no time to lose and that \"challenges stretch as far as the eye can see\".Listing out some of the challenges, Mr Guterres said, \"The climate crisis is worsening dramatically but the collective response is lacking in ambition, credibility, and urgency. Wars and conflicts are multiplying - but efforts to advance peace are faltering. New technologies are raising red flags - but actions to contain the risks remain too slow, and too piecemeal.\"He pointed out that poverty, hunger, and inequality are growing, but global solidarity is missing in action.'Climate Breakdown'\"I have come to the G20 with a simple but urgent appeal: we cannot go on like this. We must come together and act together for the common good,\" Mr Guterres said.He urged G20 leaders to show leadership in two priority areas, with the first being climate.\"The climate crisis is spiralling out of control. But G20 countries are in control. Together, G20 countries are responsible for 80% of global emissions. Half-measures will not prevent full climate breakdown,\" he said.Mr Guterres said the world has to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels - which was decided in the Paris Agreement in 2015 - alive. He also called for rebuilding trust based on climate justice, and advancing a just and equitable transition to a green economy.\"I have put forward a Climate Solidarity Pact - in which big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions, and wealthier countries support emerging economies to achieve this... Leadership also means finally delivering on commitments to developing countries - including by meeting the $100-billion goal, doubling adaptation finance, replenishing the Green Climate Fund, and operationalising the loss and damage fund,\" he said.Sustainable DevelopmentThe UN chief said the G20 must also show leadership in saving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and suggested a few measures that, he claimed, would yield immediate benefits.The measures included an SDG Stimulus of at least $500 billion per year, and a meaningful capitalisation and change in the business model of multilateral development banks to be able \"to massively leverage private finance\".Mr Guterres said these actions would catalyse SDG progress and help developing economies invest in key transitions across energy, food systems, digital, education, health, decent jobs and social protection.Striking a positive note, the UN Secretary-General said, \"All of this is within reach - but it will take all hands. No nation, no region, no group - not even the G20 - can do it alone. We must act together as one family to save our one earth and safeguard our one future.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comRussia-Ukraine ConflictAsked whether India has the credibility to be a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the UN chief said, \"I think that when you have a conflict, all efforts of mediation are extremely important... I am not very hopeful that we will have a peace solution in the immediate future. I believe the two parties have still decided to move on with the conflict.\"",

But I know India rightly cares about the international rule of law, the UN Charter and has respect for territorial integrity. I think there are things that have universal values that we all share. Those are things that I believe and India, I know, believes in those things too\" Sunak said.India has maintained that Russia needs to pursue the path of dialogue and diplomacy for an early resolution of the conflict.The British Prime Minister arrived in Delhi today for the two-day G20 Summit, which begins tomorrow.In an interview with news agency ANI, the UK Prime Minister said that he was looking to highlight the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the summit.\"When it comes to Ukraine and Russia in conflict one thing will highlight is the devastating impact that Russia's illegal invasion is having on millions of people around the world, particularly on food prices. Russia recently pulled out of a grain deal that was shipping grain from Ukraine to many poor countries around the world and now you've seen food prices have gone up. That is causing suffering for millions of people,\" Mr Sunak said.\"It's not right, and one of the things I'll be doing is making people aware of that impact of Russia's illegal war,\" he said.In July, Russia terminated its participation in a deal that allowed the export of Ukrainian grain. The agreement was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July 2022 and permitted Ukrainian ships to get around a Russian blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports and safely navigate the waterway to Turkey's Bosphorus Strait in order to access international markets.Russia is being represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the G20, who will be attending the summit on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin.On Russia-Ukraine conflict casting a possible shadow on the outcome of the meeting of the Group of 20 Developed Economies, Rishi Sunak said that he believed that the G20 under India's presidency would make \"good progress.\"\"I think there will be many things that we will be discussing here at the G20 under India's leadership, and I am confident that we will make very good progress on a range of different issues,\" Mr Sunak said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"I think the G20 has been a huge success for India.

        "text": "In its 2022 budget, the government classified cryptocurrencies as Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs).A paper proposing globally enforceable regulations for the crypto market is expected to be presented at the world's premier economic meeting.Ongoing crypto market instability has prompted a call for global coordination on regulation to fend off attempts to ban or restrict digital currencies in some countries.The cascade of crypto events in 2022, highlighted by the bankruptcy of crypto exchange firm FTX and its effect on trading and lending firms, underscored the inherent instability and weaknesses in crypto assets.These incidents also showed a significant service provider collapsing can swiftly spread risks across the crypto-asset framework, making the ecosystem vulnerable.This in turn affects the wider economy as investments lost in the crypto market are still tied to money circulating in the financial system.Under the leadership of India's presidency, the G20 countries are poised to introduce what could be recognised as the first-of-their-kind regulations governing cryptocurrencies and crypto assets worldwide.Crypto assets use the internet to operate independently from a central bank, central authority or government. They include cryptocurrency, utility tokens, security tokens and Non-Fungible Tokens.The regulations are being drawn up with the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a body that monitors and makes recommendations on the global financial system.Regulations are expected to help investors harness the potential benefits of crypto-assets while mitigating associated risks by addressing security, consumer protection, financial stability and international cooperation issues.Among these is 'cryptoisation': when cryptocurrencies and assets are substituted for a country's domestic currency and assets, circumventing exchange and capital control restrictions.The newly-drafted framework for the regulations is guided by the 'same activity, same risk, same regulation' principle. It is designed to guarantee proper protection of client assets, manage risks linked to conflicts of interest and enhance collaboration across international borders.Regulators want more robust regulations to make the crypto economy less vulnerable. The FSB's framework is a path towards this aspiration. The framework will provide input for a 'synthesis paper', with the IMF to support a coordinated and comprehensive policy approach to crypto-assets.The synthesis paper's main focus is expected to be on cryptocurrency's worldwide macro implications, that is how it may affect state and national economies with broader international consequences.It will do this by combining the policy findings from IMF work on macroeconomic and monetary issues and FSB work on supervisory and regulatory issues.The coordinated effort will lead to rules that countries can follow to ensure digital currencies are used safely and don't cause big problems for the economy.The paper, to be tabled at the G20 Summit in New Delhi in September, is expected to highlight concerns that include regulatory compliance and ensuring the companies handling digital currencies are doing it securely and responsibly.The policy paper's recommendations could chart the way for mitigating risks associated with crypto-assets.Among the provisions expected in the paper are some aiming to ensure the security of crypto-asset custody and address consumer protection and market integrity issues.It could also suggest that countries work together to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities involving digital currencies.The policy paper will help the wider community understand crypto-assets better and highlight their benefits while recognising the risks and challenges their volatile, decentralised nature poses.The paper is expected to encompass suggestions from India's presidency document as well as insights from regulatory bodies beyond the FSB and IMF.India will use the G20 summit to try to showcase its efforts in advocating for a universally acceptable framework for cryptocurrency regulations.An assembled comprehensive paper would serve as a testament to these efforts. There is even a possibility that Prime Minister Narendra Modi might proudly highlight the establishment of these proposed global cryptocurrency regulations under India's leadership during his opening speech at the G20 leaders' summit.India has already positioned itself as a global leader in crypto regulations.It has established anti-money laundering obligations for crypto operators, where they have to register with India's Financial Intelligence Unit and voluntarily report any suspicious activities.India also wants to give users the ability to digitally sign documents using a crypto token, bolstering secure transactions and digital interactions and supporting Web3, another big boost for crypto usage.In its 2022 budget, the government classified cryptocurrencies as Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) and introduced a taxation framework for them, which defined cryptocurrency selling, swapping or spending regardless of any amount or term limits.India will use its G20 presidency and work with the FSB and IMF on the synthesis paper to validate some of its national regulations. It hopes those policies can be converted to global regulations for crypto assets, promoting India as a leader in crypto regulations.If it can achieve its regulatory aims, India might find itself as a pioneer in bringing order to the evolving world of crypto-assets.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comNafis Alam is a finance professor and the Head of the School of Business at Monash University Malaysia.

Mr Owaisi also campaigned for its candidate in Dumri, hoping to make inroads in the state.Mr Rizvi, however, was able to manage only 3,472 votes, which was even lower than the NOTA votes of 3,650.

The EGI has alleged the Manipur government is trying to silence its critics with the first information reports (FIRs), and the Supreme Court has told the authorities not to take any coercive action against the EGI team named in the FIRs till Monday.Sorokhaibam Thoudam Sangita, who filed the second FIR, yesterday requested for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)to take over the case.

Power is expected to be a major theme in the coming years as India's demand for energy increases significantly on the back of strong domestic economic growth.

Adani Enterprises, the group's flagship company, rose 0.39 per cent on Friday to close at Rs 2,519.30, while its valuation crossed the Rs 2.87 trillion mark.Recent strides in the group's valuation mirror its ongoing initiatives to bolster investor confidence.

I welcome the coming together of our two parties,\" Mr Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru.Mocking the BJP over its poll tie-up with the JDS, Congress MLC Jagdish Shettar said it represents the coming together of two 'helpless' parties desperate for an alliance.\"The BJP and the JDS are at liberty to form an alliance for the Lok Sabha elections. They were in talks for an alliance before the Assembly elections but nothing came of it. Now, there are reports that may be coming together for the Lok Sabha elections. Such alliances of convenience between parties only corrode the electoral trust that voters repose in them. The credibility of such parties is also called into question,\" Mr Shettar said.On Wednesday, top JDS leaders went into a huddle in Bengaluru, at the residence of former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, to gauge the sense of MLAs and senior party leaders on an alliance with the BJP.The meeting took place in the presence of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comFor the JDS, which won a paltry 19 seats in the Assembly elections earlier this year and was struggling to retain its cadre, the electoral tie-up has come as a shot in the arm.

The BJP candidate got 34,146 votes, while his nearest rival Mizan Hossain of the CPI(M) got 3,909 votes.In the Dhanpur seat, which has a significant tribal population, BJP candidate Bindu Debnath emerged victorious by a margin of 18,871 votes.

That's why it boycotted the counting,\" he said.CPI(M) state secretary Jitendra Chowdhury blamed large-scale rigging by the BJP for the defeat in both seats, particularly Boxanagar.\"How does the CPI(M) which won the seat by 5,000 votes just six months ago, get a little over 3,000 votes now? The BJP under the leadership of Chief Minister Manik Saha has literally paralysed the administration and the police for two weeks to influence the voters, especially the minority community,\" he told reporters.The main opposition Tipra Motha which neither contested the by-elections nor supported any other party, slammed the CPI(M) for failing to put up a fight.In a Facebook post, Tipra Motha founder Pradyot Debbarma said that his party won the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) despite rigging in 2021.

After the meeting, he had said that his government would take further steps based on Mr Shah's suggestions.The controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958 gives personnel from the armed forces, operating in disturbed areas, sweeping powers to conduct operations and arrest anyone without a warrant. It also gives the personnel immunity from arrest and prosecution even if they shoot someone dead, as long as the actions are deemed necessary for \"the maintenance of public order\".An area or district is notified as a disturbed area under AFSPA to facilitate the operations of the armed forces.The disturbed area notification was imposed in Assam in 1990 and then extended periodically based on the situation. It was removed from all but ten districts in the state last year and is now limited to eight.The districts where the notification is still in effect are Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Charaideo, Sivasagar, Golaghat, Jorhat, Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao.At an Independence Day event last month, Mr Sarma had said his government would make efforts to withdraw AFSPA from the entire state by the end of this year.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"I want to assure the people of Assam that, by the end of this year, we will take fruitful steps to withdraw the AFSPA from every district of Assam. That will be an 'amritmoy' time for Assam's history and we are eagerly waiting for that day,\" he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Noting that the extension of the AFSPA was recommended 62 times since it was first imposed, the chief minister had said, \"The northeast region is now free from terrorism. In the last three years, four peace accords have been signed with rebels of Assam and around 8,000 rebels have returned to the mainstream.\"",

In multilateral discussions, the issues are very different from bilateral issues and the Chinese discuss issues of growth, and development from their own perspective. The challenge about any multilateral discussion is you have to bring consensus across every issue, every country has veto power. We've been able to work with every single country and bring them on board...\" Mr Kant said in a press briefing prior to the G20 Summit.Mr Kant further said that one of the key takeaways of India's presidency is that the world acknowledges that the country has truly revolutionized technology through the digital public infrastructure.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced that Chinese Premier Li Qiang will attend the 18th G20 Summit to be held in New Delhi, India on September 9 and 10.Quoting foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, the statement read, \"At the invitation of the government of the Republic of India, Premier of the State Council Li Qiang will attend the 18th G20 Summit to be held in New Delhi, India, on September 9 and 10.\"However, no reason was given in the statement about Xi's absence from the summit.Earlier, Reuters had reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to skip the G20 Summit to be held in India.Sources in China, two of whom said they were informed by Chinese officials, added they were not aware of the reason for Xi's expected absence, according to Reuters.The Chinese President has made few overseas trips since China abruptly dropped its Covid restrictions. He, however, attended the BRICS Summit in South Africa last week.Several G20 ministerial meetings in India ahead of the summit have been contentious as Russia and China together opposed joint statements which included paragraphs condemning Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine last year, according to Reuters.Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Xi on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit during which he highlighted India's concerns over the unresolved issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), in Ladakh.The two leaders agreed to direct their relevant officials \"to intensify efforts at expeditious disengagement and de-escalation\".Along with Xi, Russian President Vladimir Putin will also not attend the summit in India.According to a statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov is expected to attend two plenary sessions on September 9 and 10. Lavrov is scheduled to hold several bilateral talks and contacts on the sidelines of the summit.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra has said, \"The coming together of the 41 Heads of delegations, Heads of State/Govt, Heads of international organisations in India, starting yesterday is under PM's personal leadership and direction. It is essentially a celebration of the coming together of the G 20 family...This is the largest-ever participation of the Global South in India.\"India assumed the G20 presidency on December 1 last year and about 200 meetings related to G20 were organized in 60 cities across the country.The 18th G20 Summit will be a culmination of all the G20 processes and meetings held throughout the year among ministers, senior officials, and civil societies.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOne of the takeaways of India's G20 presidency is the revolutionization of Digital Payment Infrastructure, as initially very few people knew about it, but it has taken forward extensively, G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant said on Friday.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

In July, G20 energy ministers failed to even mention coal in their final statement, let alone agree a phase down roadmap, and there was no progress on the renewables' goal.The language of the climate commitment is a bone of contention, with the grouping divided on commitments to phasing down fossil fuel use, increasing renewable energy targets, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The first session will be followed by lunch, after which the second session -- 'One Family' -- would be conducted at 3 pm.PM Modi will also host a \"working lunch\" for the leaders on Saturday at the Bharat Mandapam.45 minutes -- 4:45 pm to 5:30 pm -- have been allotted for 'pull-aside' meetings between PM Modi and heads of states, after which they will proceed to the special dinner gala being hosted by President Droupadi Murmu.Notably, the theme of this year's G20 Summit, which is taking place under India's presidency, is \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\" or \"One Earth - One Family - One Future\", is drawn from the ancient Sanskrit text of the Maha Upanishad.

        "text": "A record stock-market valuation and surging foreign inflows make for a great backdrop as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to tout India's growing prominence to world leaders at this weekend's Group of 20 summit in New Delhi.Boosted by one of the world's fastest growing economies, solid corporate earnings and an unprecedented retail investing boom, India's equity benchmark is also approaching an all-time high.The milestones are a stark contrast to many emerging-market peers, not least to neighbouring China, whose economic woes and struggling financial markets have become a source of frustration for global investors. In fact, troubles at its biggest EM rival have only burnished India's appeal. Developing-market money managers are now most overweight on India in their Asia portfolios as a \"safe place to hide,\" while China ranks among their largest underweights, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report earlier this month.\"Strong domestic growth prospects, ongoing policy reforms as well as robust credit growth are tailwinds contributing to the outperformance of Indian equities,\" said Audrey Goh, investment strategist at Standard Chartered Bank SG Ltd. \"The shift to a multi-polar world would also likely benefit India,\" with the government moving to make doing business in India more attractive.India's stock market hit an all-time high valuation of $3.8 trillion this week, a perfectly timed billboard for PM Modi as the G-20 summit gives him another opportunity to showcase the nation's potential as a geopolitical juggernaut. With the West looking to curb China's influence, PM Modi has rolled out a mix of tariffs and incentives to lure companies to make in India and firms including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. are among those expanding production in the nation.Foreign investors have bought more than $16 billion worth of Indian stocks on a net basis so far in 2023, set to be the biggest inflow in three years. The nation stood out in August, when overseas funds sold shares in almost every other Asian emerging market amid a global selloff. Onshore Chinese stocks saw a record outflow last month as Beijing's attempts to restore market confidence fell flat with investors amid persistent worries over a property crisis.\"My favorite market in Asia remains India,\" Chris Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies LLC, said in a Bloomberg Television interview this week. Wood described India as the \"market I want to be in Asia for the next 10 years,\" foreseeing strong growth in corporate earnings led by a rejuvenating private investment and real estate cycle.Having nearly tripled its value since the pandemic low for global equities in March 2020, India is now the world's fifth-largest stock market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The US has seen its market capitalization about double in the period.Milan-based Generali Investments is bullish on India for its economic growth and earnings outlook, according to Michele Morganti, the firm's senior equity strategist. Generali reduced its overweight on China last month as policymakers opt for limited measures to help companies and boost sentiment over an all-out stimulus plan, he said.To be sure, there are several risks on the horizon for India.Resurgent crude oil prices threaten to worsen inflation dynamics for the central bank, which is already troubled by a surge in prices of everyday items from tomatoes to onions. Rupee meanwhile is hovering near a record low.Investors have to navigate a general election in April-May that some strategists say has the potential to swing markets. In the longer term, market watchers will also closely scrutinize India's ability to build fast and adequate infrastructure, lift education standards and create enough jobs for a burgeoning young population amid a rising threat from the increased use of artificial intelligence.Aperture Investors ranks among the holdouts that aren't boosting exposure. India needs years of improvements in its infrastructure and private-sector buildout before it can replace China in portfolios, said Peter Marber, the New York-based head of emerging markets at the firm.\"Just because financial investors are retreating from Chinese stocks and bonds doesn't lead to a complete shift to India,\" Marber said. \"There aren't nearly the number of investable companies and assets in India versus in China.\"For now though, markets are looking at the positives. The NSE Nifty 50 Index has jumped almost 6% in dollar terms over the past three months, beating the broader MSCI Emerging Markets Index by more than 7 percentage points.India is one of the biggest equity overweights at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which also expects countries including Indonesia, Mexico and Poland to benefit from the near-shoring boom as the US relocates supply chains away from China. The money manager is also bullish on Indian local-currency government bonds and dollar corporate debt as well as the rupee.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"On a relative basis, India could be the biggest winner,\" said Gordon Bowers, a London-based analyst at the firm.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

TDP supporters clashed with police personnel who reached Nandyal to take Mr Naidu in custody. He was eventually arrested and shifted to Vijayawada.In his address to mediapersons, a senior officer of the state CID referred to Mr Naidu as the \"prime accused\" in connection with the alleged fraud. \"This case revolves around the establishment of centres of excellence in Andhra Pradesh,\" N Sanjaya, Additional DGP of Andhra CID, said.\"The Andhra Pradesh government released Rs 371 crore, a large part of which was siphoned and only a small part employed to establish the centres of excellence. Most of this money was diverted through shell companies by using fake invoices.The investigation revealed that Mr Naidu was the \"principal conspirator\" in the matter and the transfer of government funds to private entities through shell companies happened under his \"active leadership\", the officer said.\"He possesses exclusive knowledge of the transactions leading to the issuing of government orders and the MoU which makes him the central figure of this investigation,\" he added.Sources in the state government alleged that Mr Naidu \"meticulously planned, directed, and executed the scam\".At the centre of the alleged scam is the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation set up under then Chief Minister Naidu to provide job training to youngsters.The then TDP government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with German engineering giant Siemens. The project was to be executed by the state skill development body in partnership with a consortium comprising Siemens, Industry Software India Ltd, and Design Tech Systems Pvt Ltd. Siemens was tasked with establishing six centres of excellence, the sources said.This MoU, they said, laid down that Andhra Pradesh government would contribute 10 percent of the project cost of Rs 3,356 crore.It is alleged that a whopping Rs 371 crore was disbursed in five installments within three months even though Siemens had not invested any funds into the project.\"Show me where my name is. How can they arrest me without basic evidence?\" Mr Naidu said during the face-off between his supporters and cops.Later, a post on his official X handle said, \"For the past 45 years, I have selflessly served Telugu people. I am prepared to sacrifice my life to safeguard the interests of Telugu people. No force on earth can stop me from serving Telugu people, my #AndhraPradesh and my motherland.\"Before he was taken away, the TDP chief asked his supporters to ensure restraint, adding, \"In the end, righteousness wins.\"Sources in the government alleged that no files related to the project were signed by then-principal finance secretary and then-chief secretary and this raises \"questions about transparency\".They added that reports suggest that attempts were made to destroy critical documentary evidence linked to the scandal.The sources alleged that a sum of Rs 241 crore was allegedly diverted to various shell companies, including Allied Computers, Skillers India Pvt Ltd, Knowledge Podium, Cadence Partners, and ETA Greens, without any tangible returns for skill development.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThey also pointed to an Enforcement Directorate probe into the case. The ED's investigation, the sources said, found that the then Andhra Pradesh government violated established norms by releasing Rs 371 crore without a tendering process. The sources in the state government said the central agency made several arrests in the case.TDP spokesperson Kutumba Rao has said the investigation had reportedly revealed alleged GST violations by Design Tech Systems that had entered into a contract with the state skill development corporation. This was probed by ED and it found diversion of funds to shell companies, he said. \"They are wrongly trying to link Chandrababu Naidu to those violations,\" Mr Rao said.",

It should hold discussions with protesters with confidence and courage and try to provide reservation to the Maratha community,\" she said.\"If they don't want to go above the 50 per cent quota cap, then a major decision will have to be taken at the national level. The central government's problems on this front are different. It faces a similar situation in many states. It will do what it can as per the Constitution,\" Ms Munde said.The Maratha community no longer wants mere promises, they don't want to be misled, they want concrete action in the form of reservation, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader added.She urged the state government not to make the Maratha and Other Backward Classes (OBC) communities quarrel between themselves.The state does not want to see the two communities fighting, she said.She asked the Maratha community members to exert pressure on the government for reservation by holding protests, and said they should not think about ending their lives over the issue.\"...Your fight is useful for the coming generations,\" Ms Munde added.The Maratha quota issue returned to centre stage when the police last week baton-charged a violent mob at Antarwali Sarati village in Jalna district after protesters allegedly refused to let authorities shift Manoj Jarange, an activist on hunger strike over the quota issue, to a hospital.Mr Jarange on Friday warned that he would intensify his ongoing hunger strike from the weekend.He has asked the government to drop the requirement to provide evidence of genealogy for the Marathas from the Marathwada area if they want to obtain the Kunbi caste certificates and avail of reservation under the OBC category.The state government on Thursday issued a Government Resolution (GR) saying that Kunbi caste certificates would be issued only after the Maratha community members from the Marathwada region provide genealogical records from the Nizam era.

(File)Hyderabad:The Andhra Pradesh Crime Investigation Department has said former chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu is the prime mover, conspirator and beneficiary of the alleged Rs 371-crore scam in the skill development corporation.Andhra Pradesh CID chief N Sanjay said the Telugu Desam Party national president was arrested on Saturday morning as he is the prime accused in the case and there is a risk of him influencing the course of the investigation.'Inflated Project Cost'In 2014, Andhra Pradesh had issued a government order stating that clusters of Siemens Centres of Excellence would be established across the state, with technology partners Siemens and Design Tech contributing 90% as grant-in-aid and the government giving only 10% of an allegedly inflated project cost of Rs 3,300 crore.A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was drawn up, but the 90% contribution by Siemens and Design Tech did not find a mention. The MoU was approved by both Chandrababu Naidu and TDP State President K Atchannaidu, who is also an accused in the case.The CID has claimed that then minister Ganta Srinivas Rao was also involved in the conspiracy, and the Andhra Pradesh Skill Development Corporation was established after bypassing the council of ministers and deviating from rules.Shell Companies\"The Andhra Pradesh government released Rs 371 crore, a large part of which was siphoned off and only a small part was used to establish centres of excellence,\" CID chief N Sanjay said. The money was allegedly diverted through shell companies and fake invoices, and no actual delivery mentioned in the invoices was found during the investigation.Mr Sanjay said Mr Naidu and other TDP leaders were among the beneficiaries of the misappropriated funds.\"Though the probe began with the Andhra Pradesh Skill Development Corporation and the head of companies, the prime mover and principal conspirator in the case, who orchestrated the transfer of government funds to private entities via shell companies, is N Chandrababu Naidu,\" the additional DGP said.\"He possesses exclusive knowledge of transactions leading to the issuance of government orders and signing of MoUs from time to time. This makes him the central figure of the investigation,\" he added.Bureaucrats Had ObjectedCID officials said senior IAS officers, including then chief secretary IYR Krishna Rao, principal finance secretary P V Ramesh and special secretary (finance) K.Sunitha, had made notings in files related to the corporation. They had objected to the advance release of funds to Design Tech and noted that this was being done on the instructions of then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu.The CID is probing to find the final beneficiaries of the misappropriated funds, including cash holdings, recovered from accused like Vikas Vinayak Khanvilkar, the then managing director of Design Tech. The department said key documents have gone missing and they had to arrest Mr Naidu to interrogate him in custody and with other primary suspects.\"The deep-rooted and serious economic offence makes custodial interrogation necessary. Being in an important position as the head of a political party and having occupied the office of the chief minister, there is a chance of Mr Naidu influencing the course of the investigation. He was the principal decision-maker in releasing money in advance from the government,\" said Mr Sanjay.Siemens Distances ItselfThe Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department and the Goods and Services Tax Intelligence Wing have also investigated the case, according to a note shared by sources in the Andhra Pradesh government.Siemens Industrial Software India Private Limited has carried out an internal investigation and distanced itself from the actions of its then managing director Suman Bose, saying he had acted without authorisation.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comSources said Siemens had also received only Rs 58.8 crores out of Rs 371 crores paid to Design Tech by the skill development corporation.

        "text": "Energy transition is a significant need of the 21st century world, PM Modi saidNew Delhi:Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed world leaders to the two-day G20 Summit in Delhi. The heads of states and representatives of nations arrived at the Summit venue - Bharat Mandapam - where they shared laughs and handshakes with PM Modi.In his opening remarks at the G20 Leaders' Summit, PM Modi mentioned a wide range of issues and highlighted the success of India's Moon Mission - Chandrayaan-3. Read the full statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi here:\"Friends,India is a land of diversity of faith, spirituality, and traditions. Many major religions of the world were born here, and every religion of the world has found respect here.As the 'Mother of Democracy,' our belief in dialogue and democratic principles has been unwavering since time immemorial. Our global conduct is rooted in the fundamental principle of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,' which means 'world is one family.'This very notion of considering the world as one family also connects every Indian with the sense of responsibility of 'One Earth'. It is with this spirit of 'One Earth' that India has initiated the 'Lifestyle for Environment Mission.' With India's initiative and your support, the entire world is celebrating the 'International Year of Millets' this year, in alignment with the principles of Climate Security. In line with this spirit, India launched the 'Green Grids Initiative - One Sun, One World, One Grid', at COP-26.Today, India stands among the countries where a large-scale solar revolution is underway. Millions of Indian farmers have embraced natural farming. This is a big campaign to protect human health as well as the health of the soil and the Earth. We have also launched the 'National Green Hydrogen Mission' in India to boost green hydrogen production. During India's G-20 presidency, we have also taken significant steps toward creating a Global Hydrogen Ecosystem.Friends,Keeping in mind the challenge of climate change, energy transition is a significant need of the 21st century world. Trillions of dollars are required for an inclusive energy transition. Naturally, developed countries play a very crucial role in this.Along with India, all the countries of the Global South are pleased that developed countries have taken a positive initiative this year, in 2023. Developed countries have expressed their willingness to fulfill their commitment of 100 billion dollars for climate finance for the first time.By adopting the 'Green Development Pact,' G-20 has also reaffirmed its commitment to sustainable and green growth.Friends,With the spirit of collective effort, today, India has some suggestions on this G-20 platform.Today, the need of the hour is that all countries should work together in the field of fuel blending. Our proposal is to take an initiative at a global level to take ethanol blending in petrol up to 20 percent.\"Alternatively, we could work on developing another blending mix for the greater global good, one that ensures a stable energy supply while also contributing to climate security.In this context, today, we are launching the Global Biofuel Alliance. India invites all of you to join this initiative.Friends,Keeping the environment in mind, discussions on Carbon Credit have been ongoing for decades. Carbon Credit emphasizes what should not be done; it has a negative perspective.As a result, what positive steps should be taken, often do not receive adequate attention. There is a lack of encouragement for positive initiatives.Green Credit shows us the way forward. To promote this positive thinking, I propose that G-20 countries start working on a 'Green Credit Initiative.'Friends,You are all familiar with the success of India's Moon Mission, Chandrayaan. The data obtained from it will be beneficial for all of humanity. With the same spirit, India is proposing the launch of the 'G20 Satellite Mission for Environment and Climate Observation.'The climate and weather data obtained from this will be shared with all the countries, especially the countries of the Global South. India invites all G-20 countries to join this initiative.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comFriends,Once again, a very warm welcome and congratulations to all of you. Now, I am eager to hear your thoughts.\"",

        "text": "The modern-day Spice Route will be unveiled at the G20 Summit in Delhi (AFP)New Delhi:A broad alliance of states on Saturday unveiled ambitious plans to create a modern-day Spice Route linking Europe, the Middle East and India, boosting trade ties with potentially wide-ranging geopolitical implications.The United States, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates and others launched the initiative to link railways, ports, electricity and data networks and hydrogen pipelines on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi.Although heavily trade-focused, the scheme could have wide-ranging implications -- including developing contacts between long-time foes Israel and Saudi Arabia.Signatories hope it can help integrate India's vast market of 1.4 billion people with countries to the west, offer a counterbalance to lavish Chinese infrastructure spending, boost Middle Eastern economies and help normalise relations between Israel and Gulf Arab states.Charting a journey of shared aspirations and dreams, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor promises to be a beacon of cooperation, innovation, and shared progress. As history unfolds, may this corridor be a testament to human endeavour and unity across continents.pic.twitter.com/vYBNo2oa5W Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)September 9, 2023\"This is a real big deal,\" said US President Joe Biden at the launch event, calling the plan \"historic\".European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the so-called India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor was \"much more than 'just' a railway or a cable\".\"It is a green and digital bridge across continents and civilisations,\" she said.One proposed project would link railway and port facilities across the Middle East -- including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel -- potentially speeding trade between India and Europe by up to 40 percent.Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, South Asia practice head at the Eurasia Group, said a shipping container that today travels from Mumbai, through the Suez Canal to Europe could in the future go by rail from Dubai to Haifa in Israel and on to Europe, saving both money and time.At present, the Suez Canal is a major bottleneck to world trade, handling roughly 10 percent of global maritime trade but often beset by disruptions.In March 2021, the giant container ship Ever Given caused a nearly week-long stoppage in Suez traffic after it became lodged diagonally in the waterway.'Game changer'At the same time, the plan neatly aligns with several of Washington's goals in the Middle East, and officials say the United States is keen to see the projects take flight.Biden's administration is actively prodding Riyadh, a major oil producer and security partner, to normalise ties with Israel after decades of conflict and closed borders.Saudi Arabia has never officially recognised Israel.US involvement could also help mend deeply damaged ties between Riyadh and Washington, which frayed after the US-Iran nuclear deal and the 2018 murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.According to details seen by AFP, the economic corridor would develop infrastructure to enable the production and transport of \"green hydrogen\".It would also strengthen telecommunications and data transfers through a new undersea cable connecting the region.French President Emmanuel Macron said work was now needed to make the plan \"real\".All the projects could also help oil-soaked Middle Eastern states wean their economies off dependence on fossil fuels.Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Center, said the plan could be a significant response to China's much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative.The so-called BRI has spread Chinese influence, investments and commerce across Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America.\"If finalised, it would be a game changer that strengthens connectivity between India and the Middle East and would aim to counter BRI,\" Kugelman posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "He said trillions of dollars are required for an inclusive energy transition.New Delhi:India on Saturday launched the Global Biofuels Alliance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging the G20 nations to join the initiative with a plea to take ethanol blending with petrol globally to 20 per cent.The Alliance was launched on the sidelines of the G20 Summit by PM Modi along with a host of global leaders, including US President Joe Biden, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Bangadesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.Besides India, the initiating members included Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Italy, Mauritius, South Africa, the UAE and the US, while Canada and Singapore are observer countries.Earlier while speaking at the G20 Summit session on 'One Earth', Prime Minister Modi also proposed launching the 'G20 Satellite Mission for Environment and Climate Observation' and urged leaders to commence work on the 'Green Credit Initiative'.\"Today, the need of the hour is that all countries should work together in the field of fuel blending. Our proposal is to take an initiative at a global-level to take ethanol blending in petrol up to 20 per cent,\" he said.\"Or alternatively, we could work on developing another blending mix for the greater global good, one that ensures a stable energy supply while also contributing to climate security,\" PM Modi said at the session attended by US President Biden, Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak among others.Prime Minister Modi said energy transition is a significant need of the 21st century world considering the challenge of climate change.He said trillions of dollars are required for an inclusive energy transition and that the developed countries play a very crucial role in this.\"Along with India, all the countries of the Global South are pleased that developed countries have taken a positive initiative this year, in 2023. Developed countries have expressed their willingness to fulfil their commitment of USD 100 billion for climate finance for the first time,\" he said.At the Copenhagen UN climate talks in 2009, developed countries had committed to providing USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries in combating climate change.However, the wealthier nations failed repeatedly to fulfil this commitment.The Global Biofuels Alliance, which the world's third biggest oil consumer wants to push during its G20 presidency, mirrors the International Solar Alliance (ISA) piloted by New Delhi and Paris in 2015 to bring clean and affordable solar energy within the reach of all.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Modi in an exclusive interview told PTI that India's proposal for a global alliance on biofuels among members of the Group of 20 major economies would help accelerate sustainable biofuels deployment in support of the global energy transition.\"Such alliances are aimed at creating options for developing countries to advance their energy transitions,\" he had said.\"Biofuels are also important from the perspective of a circular economy. Markets, trade, technology, and policy all aspects of international cooperation are crucial in creating such opportunities,\" PM Modi had said.Biofuel is a renewable source of energy which is derived from biomass. India, which imports over 85 per cent of its crude oil needs, is gradually building capacity to produce fuel from such items as crop stubble, plant waste, and municipal solid waste.While India is on schedule to double the mixing of ethanol extracted from sugarcane and agriculture waste to 20 per cent with petrol by 2025, it is also setting up dozens of compressed biogas (CBG) plants.The Global Biofuels Alliance is aimed at facilitating cooperation and intensifying the use of sustainable biofuels across sectors, including transportation.Its focus is primarily on strengthening markets, facilitating global biofuel trade, developing concrete policy lesson-sharing and providing technical support for national biofuel programmes worldwide.Such an initiative is also aimed at helping India's transition to alternative fuels and cutting its import bill, as it seeks to achieve its net zero carbon emissions goal by 2070.On the other hand, the ISA aims to mobilise more than USD 1,000 billion of investment needed by 2030 for the massive deployment of solar energy.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global sustainable biofuel production would need to triple by 2030 to put the world's energy system on track towards net-zero emissions by 2050.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comLiquid biofuels provided more than four per cent of the total transport energy supply in 2022.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

(FILE)New Delhi:The Supreme Court has awarded life imprisonment to former Lok Sabha MP from Bihar Prabhunath Singh for the killing of two persons on polling day during assembly elections in Saran district in 1995, observing that the state had not prosecuted the case fairly and rather assisted the accused throughout.On August 18, the top court convicted Singh in the case, overturning the orders of the trial court and the Patna High Court that had acquitted him.While sentencing Singh, a bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul also imposed a total fine of Rs 25 lakh on the RJD leader.Referring to Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which deals with the order to pay compensation, the court noted that Clause (a) provides for defraying the expenses incurred in the prosecution.\"We are not inclined to grant any such expenses to the state considering the fact that the state in fact did not prosecute the case fairly, rather throughout assisted the accused,\" the bench, also comprising justices Abhay S Oka and Vikram Nath, said in its judgement delivered on September 1.It said considering the conduct of the state and also the amount of trauma and harassment faced by the victim's family, it is of the view that in addition to the damages awarded under section 357 of CrPC, further compensation be awarded under section 357-A of CrPC.\"The state of Bihar will compensate the legal heirs of the two victims and the injured if alive otherwise her legal heirs in the like amount of the fine awarded above i.e. Rs 10 lakh each to the legal heirs of the victims Rajendra Rai and Daroga Rai and Rs five lakhs to the injured Devi or her legal heirs, as the case may be,\" it said.\"Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the findings recorded by us and also taking into consideration the fact that the incident is of the year 1995, almost 28 years old, awarding death sentence would not be appropriate and as such we award imprisonment for life to respondent no.2 (Singh) under section 302 (murder) IPC along with fine of Rs 20 lakh,\" the bench said in its September 1 verdict.The bench, which also sentenced Singh to seven years imprisonment for the offence of attempt to murder along with a fine of Rs five lakh, said both the sentences would run concurrently.It said a fine of this magnitude has been awarded considering the \"shocking facts and circumstances\" of the case which were considered in detail and findings were recorded in the August 18 judgment.The court directed the fine awarded to be paid as damages and Rs 10 lakh each be given to the legal heirs of the victims.It said the trial court will get a preliminary enquiry conducted with regard to the legal heirs of the two victims and the amount will be disbursed to them as per law of succession.The bench said a fine amount of Rs five lakh would be disbursed in the same manner by the trial court to the injured victim, if she is alive, and if not, to her legal heirs.It said the amount of fine and compensation be deposited with the trial court within two months, failing which the same shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue by the trial court.While convicting Singh, the court had observed that it was dealing with a case which was an \"exceptionally painful episode of our criminal justice system\".The top court had observed there was not even an iota of doubt that Singh was instrumental in making all possible efforts to \"wipe out\" the evidence against him.It had observed the three main stakeholders in a criminal trial -- the investigating officer, the public prosecutor and the judiciary -- have \"utterly failed\" to discharge the duties and responsibilities cast upon them.It had noted that an FIR was registered on March 25, 1995 at Chapra on the statement of Rajendra Rai, who said that he along with eight-nine other villagers was returning after casting their votes when a car pulled over.It was alleged that Singh, who was then contesting the assembly elections as a candidate of the Bihar People's Party, was sitting in the car and enquired as to who they had voted for.The FIR alleged when Rai answered that they had cast their votes in favour of another political party, Singh opened fire from his rifle and injured three people.The offence of murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was added later as two out of the three injured, including Rajendra Rai, died during treatment.The top court had delivered its August 18 verdict on an appeal challenging the December 2021 judgement of the Patna High Court which had dismissed a revision petition and confirmed the trial court order acquitting the accused in the case.The court had not disturbed the acquittal of other accused in the case, saying their names were not reflected either in the dying declaration of Rajendra Rai or in the statement of his mother, who was a court witness.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only

Days before the summit began, a senior US official had also hinted at this and said that it was difficult to get \"20 clocks to chime at the same time.\"John Kirby, US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, had said that the summit could end without a joint declaration because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\"Often times the sticking point tends to be the war in Ukraine because countries like Russia and China are less likely to sign on to language that the rest of the international community is more comfortable signing on to, so we'll see where it goes. But we'd like to see that, absolutely,\" Mr Kirby had said.China's support for the declaration also comes at a time when India has strongly objected to its new \"standard map\" in which it has depicted Arunachal Pradesh and the Aksai Chin region as part of its territory. The prolonged border stand-off in eastern Ladakh is another huge sticking point in India's ties with the country.When a reporter compared the New Delhi Declaration with the one at the G20 Summit in Bali last year and asked whether references to Russia and its aggressions had been kept out to get the country to sign on, Mr Jaishankar said \"Bali was Bali, New Delhi is New Delhi\".\"Bali was a year ago, the situation was different and many things have happened since then. In fact, if you see, in the geopolitical segment of the declaration, there are eight paragraphs, seven of which actually focus on the Ukraine issue. Many of them highlight problems which are of great contemporary significance,\" he said.\"One should not have a theological view of this. I think the New Delhi declaration responds to the situation and concerns as they are today just as the Bali declaration did in a situation which was there a year ago,\" the minister added.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIn the Bali declaration, a paragraph had said the group \"deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine\".The New Delhi declaration, while making a reference to Bali, states \"Concerning the war in Ukraine, while recalling the discussion in Bali, we reiterated our national positions and resolutions adopted at the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly and underscored that all states must act in a manner consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter in its entirety.\"",

The group was finding it difficult to agree on commitments to tackle the climate crisis, and the fact that a consensus emerged on the pressing issue and all members agreed to sign the declaration is being seen as a big victory for India and the world.Sticking PointsThe countries in the grouping did not only differ on the commitments being proposed, but the developed-developing nation divide - which has reared its head at almost every major summit related to climate - was also apparent.Among the sticking points for the members were commitments on phasing down fossil fuel use - which China and Saudi Arabia had objected to - increasing renewable energy targets and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.When the wording of the declaration was being hammered out, India and other developing were pushing for developed nations to fulfil their commitments, whereas the developed countries wanted \"all nations\" to focus on climate-related targets.In June, at a World Environment Day event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said poor and developing countries are paying the price for the \"wrong policies\" of some developed nations. He had said India has been strongly raising the issue of climate justice with all such countries.At a G20 energy ministers' meeting the next month, far from agreeing on a roadmap to phase down the use of fossil fuels, the final statement had failed to even mention coal. The countries that had raised objections at the time included Russia and Saudi Arabia.Key AgreementsThe New Delhi declaration speaks of phasing out and rationalising fossil fuel subsidies. It also says that the member countries will increase efforts to phase down \"unabated coal power\" and scale up the generation of clean energy.Under the header 'Implementing Clean, Sustainable, Just, Affordable & Inclusive Energy Transitions', the declaration says \"We will increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in Pittsburgh to phase-out and rationalise, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, whileproviding targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable.\"Another point in the declaration reads, \"We recognise the importance to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation, including renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards phasedown of unabated coal power, in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards just transitions.\"Among the paragraphs on supporting developing countries, one states, \"Recognising that developing countries need to be supported in their transitions to low carbon/emissions, we will work towards facilitating low-cost financing for them.\"Climate ConferenceThe New Delhi Declaration is even more important as it comes two months ahead of COP 28, the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference, in Dubai.

But G20 countries are in control. Together, G20 countries are responsible for 80% of global emissions. Half-measures will not prevent full climate breakdown,\" he had warned.",

        "text": "The World Bank is an example of a multilateral development bank (File).New Delhi:Contained within the New DelhiG20 Leaders' Declarationannounced on Saturday evening is a commitment by global leaders to \"pursue reforms for better, bigger and more effective MDBs\". In the declaration, G20 leaders acknowledged the need for an international development finance system \"that is fit for the purpose\"; i.e., one capable of helping developing countries, \"in particular the poorest and most vulnerable\", surmount economic challenges, including those posed by climate change.Of significance in the paragraph on \"Reforming International Financial Institutions\" is the G20's realisation of the need for a \"quantum jump from billions to trillions of dollars for development\".\"The international finance system must deliver significantly more financing to help developing nations and EMEs (emerging market economies) fight poverty, tackle global challenges and maximise development impact,\" theG20said, noting that stronger MDBs \"will be important\" to these efforts.MDBs also found mention in a discussion on mobilising finance to \"support the commercialisation of early-stage technologies that avoid, abate and remove greenhouse gas emissions and facilitate adaptation\" in order to \"support developing countries' implementation of the Paris Agreement\".What Are MDBs?MDBs, ormultilateral development banks, refer to banks like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. These provide \"financial and technical support to developing countries to help them strengthen economic management and reduce poverty\" and are key for climate action and to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs).The significance of MDBs on issues like combating climate change and ensuring equitable and sustainable global development has been underlined at this summit by United States President Joe Biden's active efforts to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low- and middle-income countries.Following the declaration's release, the White House said he had worked to \"fundamentally reshape and scale up the World Bank to more effectively deliver poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth\", and had asked Congress to unlock new concessional financing of over $25 billion from US action alone.MDBs And Climate ChangeEarth's global surface temperature has risen by around 1.15 degrees Celsius and the vast amounts of carbon dioxide spewed into and polluting the atmosphere - mostly by developed countries - since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century is widely seen as being a major factor.At the Paris climate agreement of 2015, world leaders agreed not to let global temperatures rise above that mark. Nearly a decade later, that has still not been reached and the G20 Delhi Declaration speaks of accelerating efforts and enhancing resources in an effort to achieving that temperature goal.READ |\"Climate Change To Be High On Agenda For PM Modi-Biden Meet\": US OfficialIt is telling that G20 leaders' consensus on \"better, bigger and more effective\" MDBs follows this.Simply put, unchecked, the world is looking at a temperature rise of around three degrees by the end of the century and the difference over a 1.5-degree increase is an uninhabitable Earth. Emissions must be halved by 2030, from 2009 levels, to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Developing countries, including India, have long argued that wealthier nations should take greater responsibility given their massive historical emissions, and provide means of implementation, including finance and technology, to assist developing nations in transitioning to clean energy sources.Role of MDBsMDBs like the World Bank are critical in ensuring the latter, as they are often the only viable ways of poorer nations funding the required infrastructure and clean energy projects.At a pre-summit briefing on Friday, Amitabh Kant, India's G20 sherpa said, \"We wanted the world to take the lead on green development in the context of the climate crisis... and because both SDGs and climate action require finance, particularly for developing and emerging markets in the Global South.\"Six years before Paris, developed nations vowed to provide $100 billion per year, by 2020, to help developing countries combat climate change. As of today, that guarantee has not been met.Should it be met in the (hopefully) near future, it will be mainly because of increased MDB financing.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comBilateral public finance - the most important indicator of direct contribution by developed countries - has not increased measurably since 2016 and there remain important shortfalls in its quality, shortfalls the G20 New Delhi Declaration hope will be covered by its resolution today.With input from agencies",

Its adoption highlighted that members have successfully clinched a consensus amid increasing tensions and divergent views over the Ukraine conflict.

We also reaffirm the role of Data for Development,\" it said.On technological transformation and digital public infrastructure, the declaration noted that technology can enable rapid transformations for bridging the existing digital divides and accelerating progress for inclusive and sustainable development. \"Digital public infrastructure (DPI), as an evolving concept and as a set of shared digital systems, built and leveraged by both the public and private sectors, based on secure and resilient infrastructure, and can be built on open standards and specifications, as well as opensource software can enable the delivery of services at societal-scale,\" it said.Put simply, DPI refers to blocks or platforms, such as digital identification, payment infrastructure and data exchange solutions that help countries deliver essential services to their people, empowering citizens and improving lives by enabling digital inclusion. A case in point is the India Stack -- the identity system Aadhaar, payment platform UPI and others, all of which have been receiving ringing praises globally.DPIs are interoperable, open, and inclusive systems supported by technology and provide essential, society-wide, public and private services that play a critical role in accelerating this digital transformation in an inclusive manner.The Declaration has also emphasised building safety, security, resilience and trust in the digital economy.An enabling, inclusive, open, fair, non-discriminatory and secure digital economy is increasingly important for all countries and stakeholders while respecting applicable legal frameworks.\"We will share our approaches and good practices to build a safe, secure and resilient digital economy.

I am satisfied that today the G20 has become a platform for optimistic efforts regarding the vision of One Earth, One Family, One Future,\" PM Modi said in his closing remarks today.Lula da Silva congratulated PM Modi, and listed social inclusion, the fight against hunger, energy transition and sustainable development as G20 priorities. He said the UN Security Council needs new developing countries as permanent, non-permanent members to regain political strength. \"We want greater representation for emerging countries at the World Bank and the IMF,\" he said.The big takeaway of the Summit were a call to end the \"global trust deficit\", the launch of the Global Biofuel Alliance, and the launch of new connectivity networks between the US, India, Saudi Arabia, and Gulf states.The G20 members unanimously adopted the Delhi Declaration, which called on nations to uphold territorial integrity and international humanitarian law to safeguard peace and stability.\"We call on all states to uphold the principles of international law including territorial integrity and sovereignty, international humanitarian law, and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability,\" the declaration said.China and Russia, whose heads of state skipped the Summit, were also in agreement with the Delhi declaration. But while the declaration called on all states to not use force to grab territory, it avoided condemning Russia for the war in Ukraine. Ukraine's foreign ministry said the declaration was \"nothing to be proud of\", adding that a Ukrainian presence would have given participants a better understanding of the situation.The bloc also said that they will aim to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030 and expedite efforts to phase down coal power in line with national circumstances but did not commit to a phase-out of all polluting fossil fuels, including oil and gas.The bloc, which represents 85 per cent of the world's GDP and contributes 80 per cent of emissions, however, said it will uphold its 2009 promise made in Pittsburgh to eliminate and rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.The African Union was inducted as the new permanent member of G20, pushing forward a new world order and offering developing nations a greater say in global decision-making.Ahead of the sessions today, the delegates visited and paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi at his memorial Rajghat in Delhi. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant will address the media at 2 pm today, after the conclusion of all scheduled discussions.Post a comment",

PM Modi called on countries to join the initiative and set a global target of blending 20% ethanol with petrol.\"The Biofuels Alliance is a historic event that will help us reduce world pollution in a major way,\" Mr Gadkari said. \"Using ethanol in petrol is a major achievement, and it will be especially helpful for farmers, who can now sell their surplus crop to fuel stations.\"India is increasing its ability to produce biofuels, a renewable energy source derived from organic matter. The country imports more than 85% of its crude oil requirements, so it is looking to reduce its reliance on imported oil by producing biofuels from domestic sources.The Alliance aims to secure the supply of biofuels, ensure their affordability, and promote sustainable production.Mr Gadkari, the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, also spoke about the importance of green hydrogen in India's future.\"Green hydrogen is a futuristic vision for India,\" he said. \"It has the potential to make our automobile sector the number one in the world.\"In 2009, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries combat climate change.

It will help to reduce air pollution, create jobs, and make India a leader in the production and use of biofuels. The alliance is also aligned with India's goal of becoming a carbon-neutral country by 2070,\" Mr. Gadkari told NDTV.The launch of the alliance coincides with India, the United States, and several major economies announcing an ambitious India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe initiative, seen by many as a potential alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative, was jointly announced by PM Modi and the leaders of the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy, and the European Union on the sidelines of the G20 summit.Once completed, the project can serve as a modern-day Silk Road that functioned as the central trade route facilitating economic partnerships, political alliances, and cultural integration across continents.",

The UK is stepping up and delivering on our climate commitments, both by decarbonising our own economy and supporting the world's most vulnerable to deal with the impact of climate change, Sunak said in a statement on the final day of the India-led G20 Summit. This is the kind of leadership that the world rightly expects from G20 countries. And this government will continue to lead by example in making the UK, and the world, more prosperous and secure, he said.According to the Downing Street update from the summit in New Delhi, Sunak called on world leaders to work together ahead of the COP28 Summit this December to both reduce their countries' own carbon emissions and support vulnerable economies to deal with the consequences of climate change.Alongside this uplift in the UK's contribution to the GCF, the UK government said it will continue to stress the importance of the GCF delivering results with even greater speed, demonstrating value for money in all of its activities.This includes asking the GCF to further improve its delivery for those countries most vulnerable to climate change, particularly Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIndia has repeatedly called on the developed world to step up to its commitments to assist the developing world in meeting the challenges posed by the climate crisis.

During this period, solar energy and wind energy roughly grew at a CAGR of 38 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.It stated that an initial investment of USD 100 billion in financial support will be required to trigger the biofuel industry, five billion for each G20 partner in the next three years.This anchor investment will have further multiplier effects on private investments and the production of biofuels, especially biogas. Creating a favorable regulatory environment in the G20 countries and sharing technological advancements will be key to the success of this biofuel alliance, it stated.Promoting international cooperation through best practices followed across G20 nations will be key to the success of the biofuel alliance, it opined.The transfer of machinery and equipment within G20 partners must be made easy for the success of the biofuel alliance.This will help G20 nations reduce their dependence on fossil fuels; their overall import bill for non-fossil fuels can be reduced by billions of USD within the next three years, helping them meet Sustainable Development Goals, it stated.Increased energy security, and creation of jobs for each country can be envisaged, it said, adding that improved air quality and a better environment can save billions in healthcare expenses.The G20 is a powerful forum that can play a major role in promoting Bioenergy.As per Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, current biogas and CBG production in the country is 1151 MT per day, and with the push to the sector, even with conservative estimates, it can go up to 1750 MT per day by 2025 in the next few years.So far as biomass availability is concerned, there is a tremendous availability of potent biomass in India, and harnessing all of these as the CBG plant's feedstocks shall lead to a whopping production capacity of 170,000 MT of CBG per day, good enough to replace one-third of the crude oil imports or three times the imported LNG, it stated.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe average cost for each biogas plant is USD 4.25 million, and with the government's target of 5,000 biogas plants, this is a huge opportunity of over USD 200 billion, it stated.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "New Delhi:Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday made a fresh push for reforms in global institutions, including the United Nations, asserting that the world's \"new realities\" should be reflected in \"new global structure\" as it is nature's law that those who don't change with times lose their relevance.\"It is necessary the global bodies should reflect today's realities to lead the world towards a better future,\" PM Modi said at the 'One Future' session in the G20 Summit, citing the United Nations Security Council as an example for a body needing change.He said the world was totally different when the UN was established with 51 founding members as their numbers have now risen to nearly 200.\"Despite this, the number of permanent members in the UNSC remains the same. The world has since changed a lot in every aspect. Be it transport, communication, health and education, every sector has been transformed. These new realities should reflect in our new global structure,\" he said.The UNSC has five permanent members; the US, China, France, Britain and Russia.He noted many regional groupings have emerged in the last many years and they have proved effective as well as he called for reflection.Pitching for reforms, he said that is why a historic initiative was made on Saturday by making the African Union a member of the G20.\"Similarly, we also need to expand the mandate of multilateral development banks. Our decisions in this direction should be immediate and effective,\" the prime minister said.In his remarks, PM Modi described cyber security and crypto currencies as among the burning issues affecting the present and future of the world. Crypto currency is a new subject for social order, and monetary and financial stability, he said, seeking the development of global standards to regulate it.Cyber space has emerged as a new source of funding for terrorism and global cooperation and framework are necessary for securing it, he said. \"This is a very important subject for every country's security and prosperity,\" he added.\"When we take care of the security and sensitivity of every country, then the feeling of 'One Future' will be strengthened,\" he said.Noting that the world is witnessing unimaginable scale and speed in new generation technology, he cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example and said G20 countries need to go beyond the \"Principles on AI\" adopted by the bloc in 2019.\"I suggest we establish a framework for 'responsible human-centric AI governance'. India will also give its suggestions. It will be our effort that all countries get the benefits of AI in areas like socio-economic development, global workforce, and research and development,\" he said.Highlighting his push for human-centric vision instead of GDP-centric approach, he said India has expressed its willingness to share data of its lunar mission data with everyone in the interest of humanity. \"It is also a proof of our commitment towards human-centric growth.\" He said the world needs to go beyond the concept of \"global village\" to make \"global family\" a reality, calling for a future in which not only the interests of the countries are aligned but also their hearts.In a fast-changing world, sustainability and stability are as much needed as transformation, he said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comLater, Modi posted on X, \"Simply having a GDP centric approach is outdated. Time has come to adopt a human centric vision of progress. India has been making several efforts in this regard, particularly in areas relating to data and technology. We must do whatever we can to use AI for socio-economic development.\" He added, \"As we pursue our development trajectories, we must keep our focus on sustainability and stability.

        "text": "Symbolism is hard to escape in the so-called family photograph.The monsoon rains eased as Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed world leaders to the Raj Ghat memorial complex in central Delhi on Sunday, site of the eternal flame that burns for Mahatma Gandhi.Gandhi led the nonviolent protests that brought India independence from British colonial rule in 1947. And PM Modi's decision to use the second and final day of his Group of 20 summit to remind his guests of the Father of Nation was another message signaling India's rise.Symbolism is hard to escape in the so-called family photograph. It's a G-20 tradition that offers a rare, unvarnished glimpse of the interaction between leaders - the warmth or chill of greetings, the backslapping, side chats, scowls or moments of awkwardness - and so points to the state of world relations.Absent from this year's lineup were China's President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, both of whom skipped the summit amid tensions with the US and its allies. (Mexico's Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who rarely leaves the Americas, also stayed away.)Indian mediareportedthat the picture would not be a traditional family photo due to disagreement over the inclusion of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who stood in for Putin.US-China rivalry and Putin's war on Ukraine were never far away from the summit and infused the joint statement. But those global challenges took a momentary back seat as leaders ambled toward the black marble monument to Gandhi for their family portrait.Barefoot walkSome, like Germany's Olaf Scholz and Canada's Justin Trudeau, walked barefoot through the wet. President Joe Biden and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - who assumes the G-20 chair from India - were among those wearing slippers or overshoes.A moment's silence was held, then traditional Indian music struck up as the G-20 heads made their way out, past a backdrop of Gandhi's ashram that was a center of the Indian struggle for freedom.Biden walked beside PM Modi as the UK's Rishi Sunak reached over to have a word. Japan's Fumio Kishida walked beside South Korea's Yoon Suk Yeol, the recent rapprochement between the two US allies on display. Lavrov, shunned by several leaders, talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has been pressing for Russia to resume the Black Sea grain deal.India's chairmanship of the G-20 was perhaps most notable for securing an unexpected consensus among leaders, in particular on the contentious language related to Russia's war, but also on global action to combat climate change and on admitting the African Union as a full member of the group.Here are a few moments captured in recent G-20 summit group photos:G20 Osaka 2019Leaders pose for a family photograph at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in 2019. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Pool/BloombergSome leaders are new, others are on their way out, a few veterans have seen it all before. But events always dictate the proceedings. Japan held the last G-20 before the pandemic upended the world. The following year's summit, hosted by Saudi Arabia, was virtual.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comWhen Argentina hosted the G-20 in 2018, these were happier days for the nation that's now suffering deep economic turmoil. Argentina - whose president, Alberto Fernandez, isn't running for re-election so is attending his last summit - has just been admitted to the BRICS grouping as it expands to 11 members from the core of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.G20 Hamburg 2017Leaders pose for a family photo during the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017.Germany's G-20 summit in 2017 was notable for a moment when fellow leaders spontaneously stood up and applauded Angela Merkel, and for the anti-capitalist riots that shook the host city of Hamburg, almost costing the mayor - one Olaf Scholz - his job.

Despite the state pointing out the anomalies in his action, he appears nonchalant and has adopted a confrontationist stance because of the support of BJP,\" Sen said.TMC state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said that the governor's penchant to becoming hyper-active in midnight hours requires notice.\"It is clear he is acting at someone's behest and is not listening to anybody else,\" he said.Responding to the TMC's allegations, BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said, \"The governor is trying to clean up the mess created by TMC in the higher education sector in the last one decade. He is working overtime to end the era of politicisation, intimidation and threat on campuses of state universities.\" \"The ruling party is humiliating the governor in most unsavoury manner as it does not like his initiative for improving the education sector, it is not concerned about the fate of students who suffer due to the chaotic situation in several state universities which remain headless owing to the TMC's blatant partisan policy to put its own candidates in the VC's post,\" Majumdar told reporters.The governor's letter writing exercise came after Education Minister Bratya Basu accused him of trying to \"destroy\" the higher education system in the state and running a \"puppet regime\" in universities.Bose had earlier warned of \"much bigger action\" at midnight in the backdrop of the state education minister's severe criticism and attacks.As the clock neared 12 am, a Raj Bhavan official said Bose has \"signed two confidential sealed letters\", one for the state secretariat, Nabanna, and another for the Centre.On the content of the letters, the official said that \"it would be disclosed later\".\"The governor signed two confidential letters tonight, one for Nabanna and the other for Delhi,\" the official added.\"You will come to know of the content of the letters later,\" the official told PTI, while hinting that the subject could be on the recent war of words between the governor and the state government.Incidentally, Bose signed the letters a couple of hours after holding an elaborate meeting with Chief Secretary H K Dwivedi at Raj Bhavan.The topic of the meeting, however, was not disclosed by either the state government or the Raj Bhavan.Earlier, on Saturday, Bose had warned of \"much bigger action\" at midnight.\"Wait for the stroke of midnight today. You will see action,\" Bose had told reporters on the sidelines of a programme.Minutes after Bose's comment, Basu, without naming the governor, mocked him by calling him the \"new vampire in town\" and cautioned the people to \"beware of him\".\"See till midnight, see the action BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE! New Vampire in the town! Citizens please watch yourselves. Eagerly waiting for the 'Rakkhas Prahar' (time of the monster), according to Indian Mythology!,\" Basu posted on X, formerly Twitter.In the continuing war of words between the West Bengal government and the Raj Bhavan over the appointment of interim vice-chancellors in universities, Basu had on Friday accused the governor of trying to \"destroy\" the higher education system in the state.The minister also charged the governor, who is the chancellor of state-run universities, with running a \"puppet regime\" in the varsities and threatening registrars not to hold meetings with the higher education department.\"The honourable governor wants to run a puppet regime by appointing people according to his whims to satisfy someone's ego. He is making a constant effort to dismantle the higher education system,\" Basu said.The West Bengal Educationists' Forum, in a statement, described Bose's comment on midnight action as \"threats\".\"It is unfortunate to witness the chancellor issuing threats of staging a midnight drama of revenge against the educationists and the officials and functionaries of the state higher education department,\" the statement said.The governor, in his capacity as the chancellor of state-run universities, recently appointed interim vice-chancellors for eight varsities, including the prestigious Presidency University, MAKAUT and the University of Burdwan, a step which was severely criticised by the chief minister as a bid to interfere with the running of state-administered universities.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comSources said the interim vice-chancellors of eight other universities have also been finalised and appointment letters \"will be issued soon\".(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

In 2019 the BJP swept the state, winning 25 of 28 seats on its own, and in May, a JDS pitched as a \"kingmaker\" flopped after it won just 19 seats.A defiant Mr Kumaraswamy, told the Congress to focus on governance and not \"comment on our party\". \"... 'you are in power... people blessed you. Do good work',\" he told reporters.Why JDS Deal For BJP?In June, sources told NDTV of the possibility of aBJP-JDS alliance.The BJP is now without a government in South India. The party was booted out of Tamil Nadu in 2021 and routed in Kerala. Both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have also proven resistant.Of these states, Telangana votes for a new government later this year and the BJP is eager to have local footprints in each state as it builds back up ahead of next year's mega election.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comWith that in mind, the AIADMK alliance has been renewed and talks are also on with smaller Kerala parties.

        "text": "The device is still in the development stage (File)New Delhi:The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) is developing an artificial intelligence-based device that would be able to read the blinking eyes of drivers and alert them or stop the train in case they are feeling sleepy, according to sources.In June, the Railway Board had asked the NFR to develop a device that could detect the alertness of train drivers on the basis of blinking of eyes.The device -- Railway Driver Assistance System (RDAS) -- will not only sound an alert but also apply emergency brakes in case a driver loses alertness for a certain period of time. RDAS will be interfaced with a vigilance control device to apply emergency brakes, the sources said.\"The device is still in the development stage and trials are on to ensure its proper functioning. The technical team of the NFR is working on it. We hope that it will be ready in another few weeks,\" a railway source told PTI.On August 2, the Railway Board wrote to the NFR and asked it to expedite the in-house development of RDAS. It also said that once the device is ready, it will be fitted in 20 goods train engines (WAG9) and passenger train engines (WAP7) as a pilot project.All the zones have also been asked to provide their feedback on the working of the system after using it so that further improvements can be made to it if needed.The Indian Railway Loco Runningmen Organisation (IRLRO), however, dubbed the device a \"futile exercise\", saying that all fast-moving trains already have mechanisms to keep drivers alert.\"Every high-speed train engine comes with a foot-operated lever (pedal) which a driver needs to hit once every 60 seconds. In case, the driver fails to do so, emergency brakes are applied automatically and the train comes to a halt. The present system is good enough to ensure that the driver is alert,\" said IRLRO working president Sanjay Pandhi.\"I believe RDAS is a futile exercise. If the railways is really serious about the safety of train operations, it should, among other things, conduct studies on aspects such as fatigue, running hours, facilities and rest hours of train drivers.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"In many cases, drivers, including women, do not get any breaks for having food or answering nature's calls during their over 11-hour duty. If these things are well taken care of, there is no need to have any RADS in engines,\" Pandhi said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The world has since changed a lot in every aspect. Be it transport, communication, health and education, every sector has been transformed. These new realities should reflect in our new global structure,\" he said.The UNSC has five permanent members; the US, China, France, Britain and Russia.He noted many regional groupings have emerged in the last many years and they have proved effective as well as he called for reflection.Pitching for reforms, he said that is why a historic initiative was made on Saturday by making the African Union a member of the G20.\"Similarly, we also need to expand the mandate of multilateral development banks. Our decisions in this direction should be immediate and effective,\" the prime minister said.In his remarks, PM Modi described cyber security and crypto currencies as among the burning issues affecting the present and future of the world. Crypto currency is a new subject for social order, and monetary and financial stability, he said, seeking the development of global standards to regulate it.Cyber space has emerged as a new source of funding for terrorism and global cooperation and framework are necessary for securing it, he said. \"This is a very important subject for every country's security and prosperity,\" he added.\"When we take care of the security and sensitivity of every country, then the feeling of 'One Future' will be strengthened,\" he said.Noting that the world is witnessing unimaginable scale and speed in new generation technology, he cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example and said G20 countries need to go beyond the \"Principles on AI\" adopted by the bloc in 2019.\"I suggest we establish a framework for 'responsible human-centric AI governance'. India will also give its suggestions. It will be our effort that all countries get the benefits of AI in areas like socio-economic development, global workforce, and research and development,\" he said.Highlighting his push for human-centric vision instead of GDP-centric approach, he said India has expressed its willingness to share data of its lunar mission data with everyone in the interest of humanity. \"It is also a proof of our commitment towards human-centric growth.\"He said the world needs to go beyond the concept of \"global village\" to make \"global family\" a reality, calling for a future in which not only the interests of the countries are aligned but also their hearts.In a fast-changing world, sustainability and stability are as much needed as transformation, he said.Later, PM Modi posted on X, \"Simply having a GDP centric approach is outdated. Time has come to adopt a human centric vision of progress. India has been making several efforts in this regard, particularly in areas relating to data and technology. We must do whatever we can to use AI for socio-economic development.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comHe added, \"As we pursue our development trajectories, we must keep our focus on sustainability and stability.

Loving others also includes joining their activities. So you can decide whether you want to follow the church doctrine or the doctrine of God.\"Whether you love God or the church, you can decide,\" he said in an apparent video response on Facebook to those who criticised his decision to take the 41-day abstinence.He also said that by 'church' he means the traditional, made-made customs.Manoj was a software engineer before he took up priesthood.He said that he took up priesthood in order to give authenticity to his spiritual teachings.Visuals showing him wearing a customary black attire used by Ayyappa devotees recently surfaced online.The priest said as the news came out, triggering a controversy, a section of members of his community criticised him and the church authorities asked him about his plans.\"My denomination has its own rules, regulations and norms. They could not accept what I have done...Questions have come up,\" he said.Manoj said he decided to give back to the church the licence it had given him to perform ritual services in order to fulfil his dream of offering prayers at Sabarimala.\"The decision was taken as they demanded an explanation. I don't want to cause them any difficulty because of my Sabarimala visit. I can understand their position,\" he added.Manoj, however, added that although the licence to perform church services has been given back, he would continue as a priest under the church.He said he would go ahead with his 'vratham' and there is no change in his temple visit plan.

        "text": "New Delhi:The Supreme Court has dismissed a PIL seeking cancellation of Centre's decision of September 15, 2021 to grant relief to the stressed telecom sector from paying statutory dues, saying these are all matters of policy and decision-making is on the basis of experts' opinion.In a breather to telecom service providers struggling to pay Rs 93,520 crore of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) related dues, the top court on September 1, 2020 gave them a 10-year period to clear their outstanding amount to the government.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said that no doubt, the apex court by its judgment had issued certain directions with regard to the telecom sector but in the backdrop of the COVID-19 challenges, with huge surge in data consumption, online education, work from home, etc., reform measures were found necessary to boost the proliferation and penetration of broadband and telecom connectivity.\"In our view, these are all matters of policy and decision-making which is on the basis of experts' opinion and on emerging situations and exigencies, to be made in the interest of the welfare of the people of India having serious technical and financial implications and, therefore, have to be in public interest.\"Hence, we do not think such Cabinet decisions could be lightly interfered with by a Court of law in the absence of there being any particulars or materials brought to the notice of the Court assailing the Cabinet decisions, as being unconstitutional or arbitrary in nature or contrary to law,\" the bench said.Contending that the writ petition filed by petitioner Anshul Gupta was without merit, the top court said any interference at this stage would not only create uncertainty in the implementation of the policy but also jeopardise the policy itself.\"Moreover, the other stakeholders, namely, the telecom service providers are not arraigned as parties to this petition. Therefore, at this stage, we do not think it proper to entertain this petition,\" it said.The apex court said it may appear in a first blush that the Cabinet decision to initiate structural and procedural reforms and provide relief measures for the telecom service providers are contrary to its earlier directions.\"It would have been more appropriate for the central government to have filed an application in this regard.\"But what is to be borne in mind is emerging situations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic that engulfed the world, including India, in the years 2020-2021 and the lifestyle of the people drastically changing on account of the precautions and preventive measures that had to be taken in order to save themselves from being afflicted by the pandemic which resulted not only in deaths but also post COVID-19 disabilities and ill health,\" the bench said.As a result, the people depended heavily on the telecom sector and particularly on the telecom service providers in order to keep in touch with one another as there were lockdowns declared in the country in March 2020, it said.\"In schools and educational institutions, and offices there was virtual study and work from home respectively. Offices were shut and classrooms were being conducted virtually. Even the governments were run on virtual mode and we could emphasise that video conferencing facility and virtual mode was adapted quickly not only by various stakeholders such as government offices, schools, other private organisations but most significantly by law courts which did not cease to function during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"Huge investments were made for establishment and expansion of the infrastructure as there was need for online education, work from home, inter-personal connect, virtual meetings and virtual courts. Since there was a heavy surge of online facilities being put to use and data consumption, the Governments, Courts, education system and corporate sector in the country depended heavily on the telecom sector and TSPs, in particular, for their various activities and for keeping their systems intact,\" the bench said.The apex court said that despite the order passed in 2020, the need was felt by the central government to bring measures and reforms in the telecom sector and in order to make available pertinent reliefs for the sector, the impugned cabinet decision was taken.\"Therefore, taking an overall view of the matter, we feel that it would not be justified on our part to interfere with a well-calibrated decision of the Cabinet solely on the ground that this Court had earlier passed certain orders on September 1, 2020,\" it said.The Union Cabinet in 2021 had approved a big-bang relief package for the stressed telecom sector that includes a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, a change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100 per cent foreign investment through the automatic route.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe measure was aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "G20: Why US Was Invested In Making Sure India Got A Win",
        "text": "India G20 Summit: India grasped the moment this G20 to assert a global leadership role (File)Xi Jinping's decision to stay away from this weekend's Group of 20 summit may have been intended to deny India its moment. Instead, Prime Minister Narendra Modi - along with the US and Europe - figured out how to more effectively counter China on the world stage.FellowG20nations hailed India's success in reaching an agreement on a joint communique that remained in doubt just days before world leaders gathered for their most significant annual diplomatic event. Apart from finding consensus on Russia's war in Ukraine, the most difficult issue, they also elevated the African Union as a full G20 member and took action on issues like climate change and debt sustainability which are priorities of emerging markets.The final outcome irked Ukraine, which saw the compromise on war language as weaker than what leaders produced just 10 months ago in Bali, Indonesia. But for the US and its allies, criticism of a communique that on substance was similar to Bali and has little impact on the ground is a small price to pay for giving PM Modi a win that bolsters India's status as a rising power capable of blunting China's global influence.President Joe Biden led the charge, seeing in India his administration's best hope of isolating China and Russia - and providing a booster shot to the US-led world order. The result showed that Washington is finally learning the language of the so-called Global South, with India as its principal guide.\"Some commentators are pointing to watered-down language on Russia-Ukraine as a sign of Western 'climbdown',\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"But there's another way of looking at it: The West is also invested in making sure India got a win. A lack of consensus would have been a huge disappointment for India.\"If there was a moment that illustrated the summit dynamics, it was Biden's meeting on Saturday to discuss White House-led efforts to deliver more financing to developing nations.Along with World Bank President Ajay Banga, the first Indian-American to hold the role, Biden was pictured with PM Modi, Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa - key members of the BRICS grouping, minus China and Russia. That bloc expanded earlier this month, posing a challenge for the Group of Seven advanced economies.Earlier in the day, US Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer swiped at China by referring to those nations as \"the three democratic members of the BRICS,\" saying they and the US were all committed to the G20's success. \"And if China is not, that's unfortunate for everyone,\" Finer said. \"But much more unfortunate, we believe, for China.\"And the US didn't stop there. It separately announced a deal with India, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other Middle Eastern countries to develop an ambitious rail and maritime network across the region. Biden hailed it as a \"game-changing regional investment,\" cementing the deal with a three-way handshake that included PM Modi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the US President had cast as a \"pariah\" ahead of the last election.That kind of pronouncement is certainly more likely to appeal to Middle East interests than badgering over human rights, even if the project's timeline and funding remain vague. The US denied it was meant to counter China's growing influence in the Gulf, but a French official acknowledged it was designed to provide competition for Xi's Belt and Road Initiative, saying that wasn't a bad thing.Xi's move to skip the G20 Summit for the first time since he became President in 2013 marked a shift in behavior from last November when he cast himself as a statesman with a responsibility to \"get along with other countries.\" China's negotiators also risked appearing petty in looking to thwart India's progress, taking a stand on minor issues like PM Modi's use of a Sanskrit phrase and the US's bid to host the G-20 gathering in 2026. The Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the Communist Party, called the US \"just a copycat\" for its Mideast infrastructure plan.Going into the Summit, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accused China of acting as a brake on progress toward a joint statement. At one point in the deliberations behind closed doors, Beijing raised the issue of access to semiconductors in a discussion of climate action, people familiar with the talks said. That prompted US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan - a leading advocate of US export controls on chips and chip technology to China - to decry \"the idea of holding climate hostage\" to unrelated issues.Premier Li Qiang, representing China in Xi's absence, told leaders that the G20 \"needs unity instead of division, cooperation instead of confrontation,\" the official Xinhua News Agency reported. That followed a commentary posted hours earlier by a Chinese think tank affiliated with the country's top spy agency, which criticized India for having \"sabotaged the atmosphere for cooperation\" at the G-20 by pushing its own agenda.But China relented on its opposition to the communique, and India drew praise from all camps for negotiating a compromise. People familiar with the discussions said the breakthrough occurred after India, Indonesia, Brazil, and South Africa jointly put forward a proposal on language describing the war.\"This consensus itself shows the cemented role of India as a trustworthy fulcrum of a world bitterly divided on geopolitical issues like the Ukraine war,\" said Swasti Rao, an associate fellow at the Europe and Eurasia Center at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses. \"There is little doubt that middle order powers wish to keep the global economic order multipolar and not fall into the Chinese game of dominating it.\"While the final language on Ukraine made some US allies uneasy, supporting the compromise presented a bigger opportunity to align more closely with major democracies in the Global South that ultimately serve as key swing nations when it comes to Russia's war and other global issues. G7 leaders publicly praised the outcome, with Sunak insisting that the language adopted was \"very strong\" and that \"Russia is completely isolated.\"\"Just and durable\"For the US, any move that bolsters India and amplifies other democracies in the Global South helps to counter China and Russia's influence, particularly when it comes to bringing about the G20's call for a \"comprehensive, just, and durable peace\" in Ukraine. Back in May at the G7 summit in Japan, the US and its allies struggled to convince PM Modi, Lula, and Indonesia's Joko Widodo to side with them on Ukraine, even after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a surprise appearance. Zelenskiy wasn't invited to address India's G20.A senior European Union official said the agreement effectively saved the G20 as the last global forum bringing together the world's major powers. Moreover, the official said, it helped bridge the gap between the G7 and emerging markets, who would now be partners in holding Russia to account if it doesn't follow through on seeking a just peace in line with UN principles.Other senior European officials said China shot itself in the foot by staying away from the Summit, allowing India to cement its leadership of the Global South and providing the US and Europe a clear path to strengthen ties with emerging markets.Even Russia, represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after Vladimir Putin stayed home, saw the agreement as a win. Moscow was pleased that BRICS democracies served as interlocutors with the G7, according to a person familiar with the situation, underscoring China's status as an outsider looking in.The US, of course, could yet stumble in its bid to appeal more to the Global South. Ahead of the G20, Biden skipped a summit in Indonesia hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a move that appeared like a snub to Widodo. The US president sought to do damage control in Delhi, meeting the Indonesian leader briefly and pledging to meet him at the White House in November, when world leaders head to the US for the APEC summit.More significantly, however, was India's ability to grasp the moment to assert a global leadership role. PM Modi declared that \"history has been created\" while his chief negotiator, Amitabh Kant, called India \"the spokesperson of all the Global South.\"PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"More than anything else, it has amplified the voice of Global South,\" Kant said of the summit outcome. \"It has also demonstrated that India has a huge capacity of bringing the world together and leading the world in developmental and geopolitical issues.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

(FILE)New Delhi:The text of G20 leaders declaration on Ukraine conflict is a \"convergent consensus\" rather than a \"divisive consensus\" and it could show a path to resolution of the crisis, official sources said on Sunday, a day after India pulled of a breakthrough on the contentious issue.It was a combination of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's guarantee and magic, the sources said while referring to total unanimity among the member nation's on the entire New Delhi G20 Leaders' Declaration.India managed to hammer out the unexpected consensus among the G20 countries on the contentious Ukraine conflict through a series of hectic negotiations with emerging economies such as Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia playing a leading role in reaching the agreement on the declaration.It is important to look at the nature of the consensus with the document as the declaration actually reflects \"47 sub-consensus\" in a range of issues, the sources said.Explaining it, they said the declaration has around 10 broad themes and 37 sub-heads and all the countries agreed on all of them.Overall, the outcome at the G20 summit demonstrated India and its leadership as a \"junction box of democratic values\", the sources said.The paragraphs on the Ukraine conflict in the New Delhi declaration must not be looked at from the perspective of last year's Bali declaration, they said.\"It is a convergent consensus rather than a divisive consensus,\" said one of the sources, noting that the approach that featured in the declaration reflected a \"stable\" framework to deal with the crisis while divisive consensus is always \"fragile\".\"The story of the consensus is a remarkable one and the overall approach in the document reflected a larger context. The paragraphs relating to the Ukraine conflict are much more than transactional. That is why the external affairs minister said Bali is Bali and New Delhi is New Delhi,\" the source said.Looking at the New Delhi declaration in the context of the G20 Bali declaration is a very transactional way of assessing the crisis, the sources said.The declaration issued at the G20's Bali summit last November had deplored in the strongest terms the Russian aggression against Ukraine while most members strongly condemned the war. The New Delhi declaration does not feature these formulations.\"With regard to the comparison with the Bali Declaration, I would only say Bali was Bali and New Delhi is New Delhi. I mean, Bali was a year ago,\" External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said at a media briefing on Saturday.\"The situation was different. Many things have happened since then. And in fact If you see in the geo-political segment of the leader's declaration, there are, in total, eight paragraphs, seven of which actually focus on the Ukraine issue,\" he said.\"I think one should not have a theological view of this. I think the New Delhi Declaration responds to the situation and concerns as it is today, just as the Bali Declaration did in a situation which was there a year ago.\" The New Delhi G20 Declaration refers only to the \"war in Ukraine\" and noted with \"deep concern the immense human suffering and the adverse impact of wars and conflicts around the world.\" Asked whether China created problems for the negotiators, the sources indicated that it was not so and said India followed an inclusive approach that focused on taking along everyone.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOn whether any European member nation raised the issue of India not inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the summit, the sources said \"no\".(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

He left the Sena in 1991 to join the Congress and later became a part of the Sharad Pawar-founded NCP.Baban Gholap said he then came to Mumbai and met then Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.\"I asked Uddhavji how a person who troubled late Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray, arrested him, filed cases against me, Raj Thackeray and many others can join the party.

        "text": "New Delhi:India will decide on implementing cryptocurrency regulations after extensive discussions with other countries, a senior official said on Sunday, virtually ruling out a ban on such assets.Ahead of G20 leaders' summit, the IMF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) had last week made a strong case for a coordinated global policy action to deal with risks posed by cryptocurrencies and said that there should not be any blanket ban.The IMF-FSB recommendations laid out a \"roadmap\" and suggested \"bare minimum\" regulations that every country should have on cryptocurrencies.If any country wants to have a more stricter regulation, it can frame a more restrictive regulation depending on the risk it sees from cryptos, the official said.\"Now G20 leaders have endorsed it (FSB recommendations) and now ministers and governments will discuss it and take it forward. We expect a lot of discussion to happen on how to implement it faster, swifter and in a comprehensive manner. We have a good framework to decide our own way forward. The foundation is ready, beyond that how much we want to go it is for us to decide in coming months and then take a call,\" the official said.India has been pressing for a global regulation on cryptocurrencies to tackle tax evasion and round tripping of funds. India's central bank RBI has been asked for a complete ban on cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ether, saying they are akin to gambling.The official said it would be difficult for one country to ban cryptocurrencies and globally a consensus has to be reached that all countries follow the \"bare minimum\" regulation that the IMF-FSB paper has outlined.\"If you want to ban it (cryptocurrency), go ahead and ban it. But if the rest of the countries are not banning it, it will be extremely difficult for one country to ban it. Now that discussion, we have to take up and try to build a consensus on regulation. Then we gradually decide on our own system. The discussion will happen now in our system. It is not an easy one,\" the official said.The fourth meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors is scheduled to take place in Marrakech, Morocco, on the sidelines of the 2023 annual meetings of World Bank and IMF from October 9-15.The official said there are risks associated with cryptocurrencies as there are the same set of entities who act as depository and clearing systems, unlike that in the stock market.\"The purpose of regulation is that the risk is well managed. Any country which feels they have more risk can make their regulation more restrictive,\" the official said, adding if all countries agree on the same regulation there will be no arbitrage.The IMF-FSB in its paper had said that its proposed regulation apply the principle of \"same activity, same risk, same regulation\", establish a minimum baseline that jurisdictions should meet, and aim to address the set of issues common across majority of jurisdictions.The New Delhi declaration issued at the end of the first day of G20 leaders' summit had said that the countries will continue to closely monitor the risks of fast-paced developments in the cryptoasset ecosystem.\"We endorse the Financial Stability Board's (FSB's) high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of cryptoassets activities and markets and of global stablecoin arrangements,\" it said.The leaders also called for timely implementation of these recommendations in a consistent manner globally to avoid regulatory arbitrage.G20 leaders also welcomed the IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper, including a roadmap, that will support a coordinated and comprehensive policy and regulatory framework taking into account the full range of risks and risks specific to emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) and the ongoing global implementation of FATF standards to address money laundering and terrorism financing risks.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com\"Our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors will discuss taking forward the roadmap at their meeting in October 2023,\" the declaration said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

It has already paid 97 per cent of the amounts due, and the appellant had sought to question the basis and the right of the respondent to levy liquidated damages to the tune of 3 per cent of the contract value.Agreeing with it, the NCLAT said: \"It is the consistent stand of Wipro that 97 per cent of the amount was paid and the balance 3 per cent was kept on hold only on account of evaluating customer satisfaction and it was established that there was a delay of six weeks on behalf of the Appellant Company in executing the job assigned to them on account of which liquidated damages/Penalty of Rs 40,56,539, which is as per the terms of the contract was levied\".\"Therefore, this Tribunal is of the considered view that there is a pre-existing dispute, which is not a spurious defence which is a mere bluster,\" said the NCLAT bench comprising Justice M Venugopal and Shreesha Merla.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.com(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Brazil will officially take over the mantle of the presidency of the elite grouping on December 1 this year.Echoing Prime Minister Modi's pitch at an earlier session for reforms in global institutions, Brazilian President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva said the UN Security Council needs new developing countries as permanent and non-permanent members to regain political strength.\"We want greater representation for emerging countries at the World Bank and the IMF,\" he said.Speaking at the 'One Future' session during the G20 Summit, Prime Minister Modi made a fresh push for reforms in global institutions, including the United Nations.\"In order to take the world towards a better future, it is necessary that the global systems are according to the present realities. Today, the 'United Nations Security Council' is also an example of this. When the UN was established, the world was completely different from what it is today. At that time there were 51 founding members in the UN. Today the number of countries included in the UN is around 200,\" Prime Minister Modi said.\"Despite this, the number of permanent members in the UNSC remains the same. The world has since changed a lot in every aspect. Be it transport, communication, health and education, every sector has been transformed. These new realities should reflect in our new global structure,\" he said.The UNSC has five permanent members - the US, China, France, Britain and Russia.He noted that many regional groupings have emerged and proved effective in the last many years and said that it calls for reflection.Pitching for reforms, he said that is why a historic initiative was made on Saturday by making the African Union a member of the G20.\"Similarly, we also need to expand the mandate of multilateral development banks. Our decisions in this direction should be immediate and effective,\" the prime minister said.Later, at the concluding session, Prime Minister Modi extended full support to Brazil and expressed confidence that the Brazilian presidency of the G20 will take forward the shared goals of the bloc.\"India passes the gavel to Brazil. We have unwavering faith that they will lead with dedication, vision and will further global unity as well as prosperity,\" Prime Minister Modi said.Prime Minister Modi also proposed a virtual G20 session by November-end to take stock of the suggestions and decisions made at the Leaders' Summit.\"In the last two days, you have put forward your views, given suggestions and a number of proposals have been put forward. It is our responsibility that the suggestions that have come forth are closely looked upon as to how they can be speeded up,\" Prime Minister Modi said.\"It is my proposal that we hold another session of the G20 virtually in November- end. In that session, we can review the issues that have been agreed upon during this summit. Our teams will share the details of it with all of you. I hope all of you will join this (session),\" he said.\"With this, I declare the G20 summit as closed,\" Prime Minister Modi said.In his remarks at the 'One Future' session, Prime Minister Modi also described cyber security and cryptocurrencies as among the burning issues affecting the present and future of the world.Cryptocurrency is a new subject for social order, and monetary and financial stability, he said, seeking the development of global standards to regulate it.Cyberspace has emerged as a new source of funding for terrorism and global cooperation and framework are necessary for securing it, he said. \"This is a very important subject for every country's security and prosperity,\" he added.\"When we take care of the security and sensitivity of every country, then the feeling of 'One Future' will be strengthened,\" he said.Noting that the world is witnessing unimaginable scale and speed in new-generation technology, he cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example and said G20 countries need to go beyond the \"Principles on AI\" adopted by the bloc in 2019.\"I suggest we establish a framework for 'responsible human-centric AI governance'. India will also give its suggestions. It will be our effort that all countries get the benefits of AI in areas like socio-economic development, global workforce, and research and development,\" he said.Highlighting his push for a human-centric vision instead of a GDP-centric approach, he said India has expressed its willingness to share data of its lunar mission with everyone in the interest of humanity. \"It is also a proof of our commitment towards human-centric growth.\" He said the world needs to go beyond the concept of \"global village\" to make \"global family\" a reality, calling for a future in which not only the interests of the countries are aligned but also their hearts.In a fast-changing world, sustainability and stability are as much needed as transformation, he said.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comLater, Prime Minister Modi posted on X, \"Simply having a GDP-centric approach is outdated. Time has come to adopt a human-centric vision of progress. India has been making several efforts in this regard, particularly in areas relating to data and technology. We must do whatever we can to use AI for socio-economic development.\" \"As we pursue our development trajectories, we must keep our focus on sustainability and stability.

It's a good achievement because right until the G20 summit was being convened, the widespread expectation was there would be no agreement and, that, therefore, a joint communique might not be possible, and, that we might have to end up with a chairman's summary.\"On Saturday, on the opening day of the G20 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said a consensus had been built on the New Delhi G20 Leaders' Summit Declaration before formally announcing its adoption.Prime Minister Modi, who chaired G20 sessions through the day, congratulated the Sherpas and ministers for working towards arriving at a common ground and eventually building a consensus among all G20 members and other stakeholders.Tharoor further praised India for bringing all member states to a consensus on the New Delhi Declaration.\"The main reason (for lack of a consensus on the statement) was the big gulf between those who wanted a condemnation of the Russian war in Ukraine and those, like Russia and China, who wanted no mention whatsoever of that subject. India was able to find a formula to bridge that gap and that is a significant diplomatic achievement because when there is a Summit without a joint communique, it is always seen as a setback for the chairman,\" Mr Tharoor added.On the conduct of the G20 summit under India's presidency, Tharoor said the government actually made it a 'people's G20', adding that it was also an attempt by the \"ruling party\" (BJP) to turn the mega huddle of world leaders into an \"asset\" for themselves.\"Things that were remarkable about the government's conduct of the presidency was that they did something that no previous G20 presidency has done. They actually made it a nationwide event, 200 meetings in 58 cities with huge amount of action, they converted the G20 into a sort of people G20. With public events, the university connect programmes, civil societies, all these things were done under our presidency. That is in some ways both a credit to India for taking a message of G20 to the entire people. But it was also an attempt by the ruling party to instrumentalize the G20 as something that would turn out to be an asset for them,\" Mr Tharoor said.Prime Minister Modi, while announcing the conclusion of the G20 summit on Sunday, proposed to hold a virtual G20 session in November to review the suggestions and proposals made at the premier forum for international economic cooperation.On that, Mr Tharoor said, \"They have every right to do that, they are the ruling party. Many countries have hosted the G20 event, but never a ruling party has celebrated its leadership in such a way, the whole Vishwaguru concept, the posters of Mr Modi every 50 meters in Delhi. All of these are advertising the G20 as if it was the personal achievement of Mr Modi and the BJP government and that I think has raised some eyebrows.\"Before declaring that the summit closed, PM Modi handed over the ceremonial gavel of the Group of 20 presidency to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIndia assumed the G20 presidency on December 1 last year and about 200 meetings related to G20 were organised in 60 cities across the country.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

WHO has reported that there are at least eight different batch numbers of falsified versions in circulation,\" the DCGI said in a communication to the state drugs controllers.Adcetris (Brentuximab Vedotin) is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma after the failure of an autologous stem cell transplant and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma.On September 6, the DCGI issued another advisory, referring to a safety alert issued by the WHO on September 4 for falsified product Defitelio (Defibrotide) 80 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, manufactured by Gentium Srl.\"This falsified product has been detected in India (April 2023) and Turkiye (July 2023), and was supplied outside of regulated and authorised channels,\" the WHO said.It said the genuine manufacturer of Defitelio has confirmed that the product referenced in the alert is falsified.\"The use of falsified Defitelio will result in the ineffective treatment of patients and may pose other serious risks to health because of its intravenous administration and could be life-threatening in some circumstances,\" the health body of the United Nations (UN) said.Following the safety alerts for both the products, the DCGI has advised doctors and healthcare professionals to carefully prescribe drugs and educate their patients for reporting any adverse drug reactions (ADRs).The DCGI has also asked the state and regional regulatory offices to instruct their officers to keep a strict vigil on the movement, sale, distribution and stock of the mentioned drug products in the market.They should also draw samples and initiate necessary action in accordance with the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the rules made thereunder, the DCGI said.For consumers and patients, the apex drug regulator has asked them to be careful and only procure the medical products from authorised sources with a proper purchase invoice.On August 31, the DCGI had issued an advisory alert against Abbott's antacid Digene gel, citing safety concerns as the United States-based drugmaker voluntarily recalled several batches of its Digene gel in India after the drug regulator raised an alert.The DCGI had asked the consumers and patients to discontinue the use of Digene gel, which is manufactured at a Goa facility.As for wholesaler and distributors, the DCGI had said the impacted product, with all batch numbers, manufactured at the Goa facility within the active shelf life to be removed from distribution.Reacting to the development, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited said Adcetris (injection) should be procured only from the authorised distribution sources.\"We would like to clarify that the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has issued a general advisory cautioning against falsified versions of Adcetris Injection (Brentuximab vedotin) identified in India.\"Takeda has been authorised by the Drug Controller General of India to import, sell and distribute Adcetris in India, and we make it available to our patients here through well-established supply chain networks. We strongly recommend that Adcetris should be procured from Takeda authorised distribution sources only,\" the firm said in a statement.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comIt said falsified medical products pose a significant threat to public health and asserted that the firm is committed to safeguarding the integrity of its products and supporting the fight against falsified medicines in order to protect patient safety, \"which is our highest priority\".(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

They have done this all their lives, he added.On Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray's statement that a \"Godhra-like\" incident may take place after the inauguration of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Thakur claimed some people have forgotten their ideology for the greed of power.\"I don't know what Balasaheb (late Shiv Sena founder and Uddhav Thackeray's father) would have thought today and what Uddhav ji is doing today for the greed of power. Rahul ji and Uddhav ji did not say a word when so many things were said about Sanatan Dharma,\" Mr Thakur added.Mr Thackeray on Sunday claimed a \"Godhra-like\" incident may take place during the \"return journey\" of a large number of people expected to converge in Ayodhya from across the country for the inauguration of the Ram Temple.The temple is likely to be inaugurated in January 2024, ahead of the Lok Sabha polls due next year.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comOn February 27, 2002, 'karsevaks' returning from Ayodhya on board the Sabarmati Express were attacked and their train coach set on fire at Godhra station in Gujarat, leading to several deaths that triggered largescale riots across the state.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

How can the Durpai area have two owners, as stated under the looping system? Every single infrastructure in Durpai is built by the Arunachal Pradesh government, Mr Kena said.The locals of Durpai are the real owners of the land and they will not go to Assam, he said. If our concern is not addressed, the villagers will write a letter with their blood to the Chief Minister but will never accept Durpai as part of Assam, Mr Kena said.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Arunachal Pradesh counterpart Pema Khandu signed the MoU.DVDC General Secretary Regi Bui said the villagers would not allow the regional committee members to visit the place for the second round of ground verification. Durpai is one of the oldest villages of the undivided Siang district. We have sufficient evidence to claim our rights. Therefore, we cannot give an inch of land from the area to Assam, he said.It is stated that Kompek, Mingmang and Ruti villages were already marked for Assam during the Namsai Declaration.Chief ministers of the two states signed an agreement to end border issues on July 15 last year too and decided to restrict the number of disputed villages to 86 instead of 123. It was called Namsai Declaration after the name of the place where their meeting was held.Mr Bui asserted that the villagers will not allow the proposed construction of a hydropower plant in the district if their demand is not met.An out-of-court settlement should benefit both sides without impacting anyone, he said.Assam and Arunachal Pradesh share an 804.1-km-long border.Arunachal Pradesh, which was made a union territory in 1972, has been maintaining that several forested tracts in the plains traditionally belonged to hill tribal chiefs and communities and these were unilaterally transferred to Assam earlier.After Arunachal Pradesh achieved statehood in 1987, a tripartite committee was appointed, which recommended that certain territories be transferred from Assam to Arunachal Pradesh.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comAssam contested this and the matter was in the Supreme Court for a long time.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Whether Article 20 (1) of the Constitution will have any bearing or relevance in the context of declaration of section 6 (A) of the DSPE Act as unconstitutional?,\" Justice Nath said.\"The declaration of section 6 (A) of the DSPE Act as unconstitutional and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution would have a retrospective effect or would apply prospectively from the date of its declaration as unconstitutional?\" he said while reading out the third question.Answering the questions, Justice Nath said section 6(A) of the DSPE Act is a part of the procedure only in the form of a protection to senior government servants and does not constitute any new offence or sentence.\"Article 20 (1) of the Constitution has no applicability either to the validity or invalidity of section 6 (A) of the DSPE Act,\" he said.The bench had reserved its verdict on the issue on November 2 last year.In March 2016, a two-judge bench of the apex court had referred the issue to a larger bench.\"The provisions of section 6A(1) do indicate that for officers of the level of joint secretary and above a kind of immunity has been provided for. Whether there can be a deprivation of such immunity by a retrospective operation of a judgment of the court, in the context of Article 20 of the Constitution of India, is the moot question that arises for determination in the present case,\" the top court had said while referring the matter to a larger bench.The question had cropped up when the top court was dealing with an appeal filed against an order of the Delhi High Court.The high court had passed the order while hearing a plea by a man, who was the chief district medical officer, and was accused of demanding a bribe. The CBI had arrested him while allegedly accepting bribe.He had challenged his arrest on grounds that it was meticulously pre-planned, and did not enjoy the exception under section 6A(2) of the DSPE Act.Section 6A(2) of the Act states that prior approval is not required if an arrest is made on the spot while accepting or attempting to receive a bribe.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe high court had asked the CBI to seek the Union government's approval to conduct fresh investigation in the case.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

PM Modi called on countries to join the alliance and set a global target of blending 20% ethanol with petrol.India is increasing its production capacity of biofuels, a renewable energy source produced from organic matter. The country imports more than 85% of its crude oil requirements, so it is looking to reduce its reliance on imported oil by producing biofuels from domestic sources.What is The Global Biofuels Alliance?The alliance was launched to develop an alliance of governments, international organisations, and industries to promote the adoption of biofuels. The alliance aims to ensure the reliable and affordable supply of biofuels, while promoting sustainable production methods.In 2009, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries combat climate change. However, this promise was not fulfilled. The agreement on the Global Biofuels Alliance during India's presidency of the G20, as the world's third-largest oil consumer, is therefore seen as a significant moment for the country, which is being hailed as the voice of the Global South.The Global Biofuels Alliance mirrors the International Solar Alliance which was launched in 2015 by India and 120 signatory countries in Paris. The ISA's main aim is to bring clean and affordable solar energy within the reach of everyone. Similarly, the biofuels alliance will work toward providing biofuelsHow It Will Benefit IndiaThe launch of the Global Biofuels Alliance is a significant milestone in the global effort to end reliance on fossil fuels. For India, which imports more than 85% of its crude oil, the alliance presents an opportunity to reduce not just the cost of importing oil but also its reliance on oil and gas. The workings of this alliance will also help mitigate the challenges posed by climate change.\"The Biofuel Alliance is a win-win situation for Atmanirbhar Bharat. It will help to reduce air pollution, create jobs, and make India a leader in the production and use of biofuels. The alliance is also aligned with India's goal of becoming a carbon-neutral country by 2070,\" Union Minister Nitin Gadkari told NDTV recently.India aims to blend 20% ethanol extracted from sugarcane and agricultural waste with petrol by 2025 and is also simultaneously setting up dozens of compressed biogas (CBG) plants.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comThe Global Biofuels Alliance will accelerate India's existing biofuels programmes, such as the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) programme - an initiative aimed at setting up compressed biogas production plants, and the Gobardhan scheme which converts waste products to clean energy. This will help to increase farmers' incomes, create jobs, and boost the overall development of the Indian ecosystem.The global ethanol market is projected to grow from $99.06 billion in 2022 to $162.12 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1%.",

But he described Mr Dhariwal's comment as a blot on that masculinity .Mr Dhariwal, who is the state's urban development and housing minister, had triggered a row in March 2022 when appeared to justify rapes in the state Assembly, saying, \"Rajasthan mardon ka Pradesh hai.\" Targeting him, Mr Shekhawat said that when Dhariwal insulted Rajasthan through his comments in the Assembly, Congress MLAs laughed and clapped like \"impotent men\" and \"eunuchs\".The opposition BJP has been mounting attack on the ruling Congress over the minister's remark ahead of the Assembly elections due later this year.Mr Shekhawat said, \"Rajasthan was insulted on the day when Shanti Dhariwal said that more rapes happen in Rajasthan because Rajasthan is a state of men. Behind him, Congress MLAs were laughing and clapping like impotent men and eunuchs when he made the statement.\"\"Certainly Rajasthan is a state of men. Because of the masculinity of Rajasthan, Hinduism and Sanatan Dharma are alive in India today. If Prithviraj Chauhan, Bappa Rawal, Rana Sanga, Veer Durgadas, Rao Chandra Sen, Maharana Pratap had not been born in Rajasthan, then today our name would have been something else, he said.\"Who did the work of blackening the masculinity of Rajasthan? This Gehlot government did it and it is unfortunate that even today he (Dhariwal) is a part of the cabinet. He is still a minister. He should be thrown out, thrown into the Arabian sea, Mr Shekhawat said.The Union minister and BJP leader targeted the state government over law and order, government recruitment examination paper leaks and other issues.He said Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's only focus was to save his chair and he even called his former deputy Sachin Pilot \"nakara and nikamma\" (worthless).\"Their infighting came out in the open and it was not the Congress that suffered, it was the public that had to suffer because of this,\" he said.He also accused Congress leaders of patronising mafias.PromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavn.comUnion minister Arjun Ram Meghwal and other leaders were present in the public meeting.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
